# Transcript Episode 11 Laurie Barth
**Michaela:** [00:00:00] Hello and welcome to the software engineering unlocked 
podcast. I'm your host, dr. McKayla. And today after catch up to talk to Laurie 
Barth also known as Laurie on tape on Twitter. Laurie is a staff engineer at 
Gatsby where she works on the learning team. Laurie is also an ed tech 
instructor. And the vivid conference speaker.
I love following your content on Twitter, where Laurie always asked many thought 
provoking questions and helps people increase and reflect on their skills as a 
leader. So thank you, Laura, for being on my show today. 
**Laurie:** [00:00:31] Yeah, I'm excited to be here, 
**Michaela:** [00:00:34] Laurie. I would like to start with your role at Gatsby. 
Um, I think you recently transitioned to get speed.
What do you do on your day to day work? What does it look like on a day to day 
basis to work there? Yeah. 
**Laurie:** [00:00:46] So I started here in October. No day is the same. I think 
kind of all software engineers can say that in one way or another. But my job is 
really to teach in whatever form that may take it, to help people understand how 
to use Gatsby.
And that means every day is a little bit different. Some days I'm collaborating 
with teammates. Some days I'm writing documentations. Some days I'm prepping for 
a webinar or a talk. Um, other days we're, you know, kind of in the planning 
stages and looking at what do we want to do next? How do we want to be 
innovative?
I think a lot of people kind of know Gatsby and our documentation experience and 
our learning experience is something that's a little bit unique. We put a lot of 
focus on it and we spend a lot of time on it. And so we're always looking for 
ways to kind of change. Our approach and improve it and make it.
A learning tool that can be helpful to all kinds of different people who kind of 
understand and get their knowledge in different ways. So, yeah, that's my, my 
day to day is there is no day to day. I wake up, I go to the, my office in my 
house. I sit down at my computer. Yeah. Say, okay, what am I tackling this 
morning?
**Michaela:** [00:02:01] Okay. Yeah. So it was really exciting. And would you 
describe your role a little bit like a developer relations or a developer 
advocacy role as well? It sounds for me a little bit like that. 
**Laurie:** [00:02:13] Um, so yeah, there are some similarities, there are 
certainly some overlap in terms of the fact that, you know, we're an open source 
project.
And so, um, every time I'm reviewing someone's PR, um, or maintaining the 
project or the docs I'm interacting with the community, my goal is always to 
make sure that our docs and our learning experience is something that works. For 
developers because developers are our users, but it also diverges in some other 
ways in that, you know, it's not my job to say.
Um, you know, be traveling all the time or to spend all of my time on Twitter, 
even though jokingly, it may seem like it. Um, it's, it's not necessarily my job 
to do all of that interaction. I do it because I enjoy it. Uh, but my focus is a 
little bit more laser focused on specifically teaching and learning instead of, 
um, advocating for Gatsby as a platform or a product.
**Michaela:** [00:03:12] Okay. So you said that the learning experience is 
different or unique and well different than others. So what would you say makes 
it unique? What's different there. 
**Laurie:** [00:03:25] Yeah. Um, so. So if you go to the guests, B documentation 
site, you'll see. I mean, it's all on Gatsby, js.org for people who don't know, 
you'll see a bunch of different tabs.
And one of them that a lot of people talk about is that we have a tutorial tab 
and under our tutorial, you do kind of a soup to nuts walk through of how to put 
together a guest we site with all kinds of different bells and whistles. And, 
um, I saw this great quote that. Dan Abraham off tweeted yesterday that was, um, 
assume zero knowledge and infinite intelligence.
And so that's exactly what we do. We believe that absolutely everyone has the 
capacity to learn this. We try and make it as straightforward as possible, but 
we also start from the very basics of what you need to know. We talk about how 
to install, note on your computer. Um, We talk about how to set up, get, or 
install that if you don't have it, because we're lowering the barrier to entry 
for creating performance sites that have a great ecosystem of plugins and all of 
these other things, but lowering that barrier to entry.
Means meeting people at whatever level they're coming into the process. So if 
they're already a software engineer, they may start at step one of the tutorial. 
Um, if they're already someone who knows react, they may start a little bit 
later, but it's about making sure that everyone's experience is covered, um, in 
our learning tools.
**Michaela:** [00:04:55] Yeah. I really like this philosophy. That resonates a 
lot. Yeah. Because sometimes if you're starting out, I actually made the choice 
last year to use Hugo, uh, for one of my sites, just to try it out. Right. And 
if you are really new to something you're really. You're dependent on the 
ecosystem that's around.
Right. So you have to decide whether or not the documentation is good enough 
that you can invest in that technology. Right. So one of my questions is, do you 
see that from the adoption? Betterman's right. There are different groups of 
people adopting GetSpeed and other, you know, other study site generators.
**Laurie:** [00:05:36] Yeah. So I can't necessarily say it from a, from a data 
driven perspective. I've seen various sets of data, but nothing that I could 
kind of recall off the top of my head, but I can, from an anecdotal point of 
view, say that we hear a lot about how our documentation helps people onboard a 
lot faster. We hear a lot from people who say getting started with Gatsby was 
easy.
And that's our goal. And so I would hope and assume that that has some impact on 
adoption of the technology. Uh, but I don't want to kind of take my anecdotal 
evidence and turn that into to hard data. Um, I know there are other people at 
the company who probably do have that data and can point out and say, yes, 
Laurie, that's a thing.
Um, thing that I can kind of like. Yeah right now. So I wouldn't want to turn. 
**Michaela:** [00:06:25] Yeah, sure. Um, so, and actually, um, because I'm 
following you on Twitter, I know that you said that you actually switched from 
architectural role, right. Being in software iTech to actively developing 
software again, and that somehow this changed.
It probably felt a little bit rusty coming back to developing, but then you 
said, well, it actually it's changed how I see the things and I'm, you're even 
better developer right now. Is that okay? Is that correct? What I got out from 
your teeth or was the experience different? 
**Laurie:** [00:06:57] Yeah, it's, it's a slightly more complicated story.
I like your simplified version. Um, yeah, complicated story is that my, my 
previous role to working at Gatsby was as a consultant and that meant that kind 
of my clients changed and my projects changed and I spent a lot of time doing 
architecture. Um, and one of the last clients I worked with while I was still in 
that role.
Um, required me to go back and be a lead engineer and, um, work on a few 
project. And I really enjoyed that. And that's what the blog posts that you're 
thinking of. Um, I believe it's how, uh, being a software architect made me a 
better coder. Um, this was that blog post blog post came out of, um, I would say 
in my role at Gatsby, yes, I am still coding.
Yes. I'm doing a lot of writing. Um, but some days I still feel like I do a fair 
amount of architecture and it's not necessarily. Software architecture, it's, 
um, information architecture in deciding kind of how are we going to structure 
this documentation experience or this learning experience for other people.
And then if you know, I'm doing a webinar and I have to make a repository, then 
I go back and put on my software architecture hat. 
**Michaela:** [00:08:08] Yeah. I mean, especially with block and I think this is 
probably similar to, you know, providing documentation and learning yeah. 
Experience. I started writing something, there comes, you know, more and more 
things and now we're getting down a rabbit hole.
And then later on, I decided, well, actually I have to research structure the 
whole thing again. Right. Which is very similar to architecture. Right. Where 
you have to think, okay, which parts are actually belonging together? You know, 
how can you actually make that? Not. You know, the monster gigantic block posts 
ever that nobody wants to read and still it's self contained and things like 
that.
Right. Um, so yeah, uh, 
**Laurie:** [00:08:45] not a science. 
**Michaela:** [00:08:47] Yeah. Well, some of my blog posts that I wrote, I 
think. Two months ago, three months ago, I go and say, wow, wow, this is way too 
long. But it is, I find it was like, no, it cannot be shorter. Cannot be 
shorter. 
**Laurie:** [00:09:02] What am I? The first one of my first blog post that, um, 
was more technically heavy, um, included a lot of code samples was actually on 
Gatsby and it was three parts.
I did it in three separate blog posts. And it was about moving my personal site 
over from Jekyll to Gaspe. Um, and that. The process of doing that, the process 
of writing that taught me a whole lot. I'm one of those blog posts was adapted 
into a tutorial that currently exists. Something gets the site like it probably 
led to the job I have now, you know, super, super impactful.
But I looked back at it the other day. Cause I had to look through it for 
something, the tutorial that was a consequence of that blog post. And I was 
like, Oh God, I need to rewrite this. So, you know, you evolve, you get a lot 
better. Exactly. 
**Michaela:** [00:09:51] Yeah. Yeah, that's true. So you're already hinted a 
little bit added that this blog post might have impacted you, how you get to get 
speed, how you got that role.
Can you tell me a little bit about how you started working at Gatsby and you 
know, what was your interview process like as well? 
**Laurie:** [00:10:10] Yeah. Um, so, so they had an opening, they just posted an 
opening for us. Daft software engineer, um, for the learning team. And at the 
time I had been doing a lot of things, content creation.
I ha I was a new egg head instructor. I was writing a blog post every week. I 
was doing a lot of speaking. Um, so kind of what most people would consider kind 
of traditional dev REL activities, but I had much more of a. A specific 
learning, bent to it. Um, for me, I had never been representing a company and 
then hearing from developers and bringing that information back to a product 
team, which is what a lot of devil people are doing.
Um, my experience had just been, I was working for a consulting company. I was 
learning a lot, working on a lot of different projects and I wanted to be able 
to teach people the things that I had learned. Um, so I applied to the job. Um, 
after talking to a handful of people on the team and said, Hey, you know, tell 
me more about this job.
Will I only ever be writing the answer is no. Um, the days you get to write are 
the good days that you have focused on, cause you don't have a million other 
things to do. Um, the interview process was honestly pretty, pretty extensive. 
Um, and I tend to people who follow me on Twitter, know that. I'm anti arduous 
interview processes.
I don't like whiteboarding. Um, I think algorithms are kind of a ridiculous 
benchmark. Um, so it's, it says something that I went through. A set of 
interviews that were pretty long. Um, but none of them were any of those things. 
So my first round was just a quick conversation about the job in my experience.
My second round, uh, was I think an hour long conversation with my now boss, 
Marcy Sutton, who people may have seen, um, She's awesome. You should follow her 
and just love everything she does. Cause it's amazing. And then my next round 
was to write a short blog post based on there were three different prompts I 
could choose from that felt very natural to me.
It's very much. Like the work that I do now on the job, then I had another Paul 
that was a pairing session, but the pairing session was about, you know, working 
with GitHub and reviewing PRS and, you know, being an open source maintainer. 
Um, and then the last, the last round was a paid project. And again, there were 
three different things I could pick from to do.
And so if it's five rounds, like if you tally all that out, that's a lot around, 
but they do certain things, well pay you to do the kind of take home pieces of 
it. They time box them and they want you to actually fit in that time box. Um, 
but they also give you about when you're using your time for that.
But everything I did in that interview, Was directly related to work I would do 
on the job. And for me, that was the benchmark. 
**Michaela:** [00:13:03] And so when you say the time box had, how, how long 
does such a take home exercise or a project take? 
**Laurie:** [00:13:12] Yeah, I don't specifically remember the blog post one, 
but I remember the final project they said, please spend no more than.
I can't remember if it was two or four hours. Um, but, but it was specific 
timebox to that. And I, and I held myself to that, you know, I turned into 
something that wasn't perfect and polished, but I spent the time I was going to 
spend on it. Um, and, and I want it to be, I want it to be honest about that, 
because I think when you're going through an interview process, it's incredibly 
tempting to want to get everything right.
And spend extra time if you have it and then kind of say, Oh, I only spent this 
much time and like sneak in, but that's not a realistic view of what you can 
contribute and get done. And you don't want them to come in with an inflated 
view of that, because then you're going to spend, you know, 60 hours a week 
trying to do what they think you can do in 40 hours.
And nobody wants that that's recipe for burnout. 
**Michaela:** [00:14:05] Yeah. I think also, I mean, if you're, if you are a 
little bit further in your career, right. And maybe you're also a little bit 
more self confident, then the interview process is also for you to evaluate the 
company as well. Right. So especially, I think if you have been burned.
Already in one of your jobs, then you get a little bit more cautious about that. 
And so if I get a take home project, right, and they say spend not more than 
four hours and I spent four hours and they see you well it's way, uh, not enough 
time. Right then this tells me something, right? Like I had a manager that.
Always overestimated everything right. Or underestimated what it takes. And 
that's really annoying and frustrating to work in that environment. Right. It's 
like, who wants that person that cannot, you know, realistically judge, how long 
something takes right. A couple of hours and you have done it. Right. And I 
think, yeah, so.
I think it's good that you did that. Yeah. So, well, I saw that and now you're 
an open source maintainer, right. And I think also means that you have to look 
through code reviews. You have to look through. For requests or, or merge 
requests. So, um, people are sending in their patches to the software and you 
have to review them and decide, you know, is that work good enough to be 
integrated?
What should be changed? And, um, what do you think what's the most challenging 
for you in that role? 
**Laurie:** [00:15:39] It's a fire. Most people who contribute don't necessarily 
realize that. Reviewing these PRS are not the only thing we do every day. And so 
it's perfectly reasonable. I know this because I was this person, right.
Like I put in my tutorial on Gatsby image and I didn't hear back in, you know, 
24 hours or whatever it was. And I was like, Oh, I guess they don't like it. 
Because I just had no concept of the number of PR is the people we're putting 
in. And the amount of time it takes to review this stuff, especially something 
as large as a tutorial, I was completely oblivious to that.
And now from the other side, I understand it's so much better. I'm sitting there 
and I'm thinking, you know, it takes a really long time to review some of these 
technically complex and extensive write ups or coaching changes. And so the 
hardest part is, is trying to be timely with, with reviews as much as possible.
I mean, even with the team members, we have both on learning and Encore, they're 
stuff that just, you know, it, it takes a little while. So to anyone out there 
who has ever contributed, we absolutely value what we do, what you've, you know, 
taking the time to give to us. We appreciate it so, so much. Um, We're sorry if 
it, if it doesn't get done and you know, a day or two, when it takes a little 
bit longer, we try so hard to keep that time down, but it's just not always 
possible.
So that, that would be the hardest part I would say. 
**Michaela:** [00:17:08] And so coming back to contributes because it's one of 
my favorite topics. I think it's a very interesting topic because of, well, the 
technical aspects and the social aspects. Some people don't like, or dislike 
contributes because they see them as gatekeeping or, you know, hindering people 
to contribute and things like that.
What's your view on it. And how do you do them? 
**Laurie:** [00:17:34] Yeah. So code reviews they're they're like anything else 
if done? Well, they can be great if done poorly, they can be horrible and bad 
for yourself esteem and, um, kind of. Abusive in some ways. So code reviews are 
for us are important because they're how we vet stuff.
That's coming into the project. It's open source. We want to make sure we're not 
including stuff. That's gonna break, um, behavior for other people. We want to 
make sure that it's going to be useful to not just the person who wrote it or 
produced it. So we have standards. We have the style guide, we have other stuff 
that we kind of point people to that.
Ensures consistency across the board. When it comes to making individual 
choices, we're focused on more on behavior of the code testing of the code or 
the writing, instead of did you write this the way I would write this as long as 
there aren't any serious performance impacts and we think that it is.
Maintainable over time. It's not ticky tack. I think that's where people get 
frustrated with code reviews and they feel like they go wrong because they're 
saying, you know, you should have used reduce instead of a four loop here. And 
it's like, There's an, it's an arbitrary choice based on the person doing the 
review, instead of something that's either documented as a policy that exists in 
that code base or something that actually has a measured reason for doing it 
like performance or accessibility when it comes to tone.
I think that's the other thing people really mess. Uh, they talk to, to their 
person who's coded being reviewed and they're dismissive or short or, um, 
Derogatory or any number of other kind of frustrating and upsetting things. So 
gets me, has the concept of you belong here and we try and be incredibly 
empathetic and kind and communicative with all of our contributors are we are so 
thankful for their time and their energy and the value that they provide to us 
just because they want to.
So our tone is very important to us and we try very, very hard to. Both be 
gracious. And to note that any kind of edits are not criticism, it's just, 
there's a reason for it, whether it be the style guide or, um, impacts elsewhere 
in the, in the system. So we try not to have arbitrary commentary and I think 
that helps a lot.
Yeah, I think, 
**Michaela:** [00:20:01] and often people also say, Oh, code reviews about the 
code, not a person. Right. Most of the things are about the person, right? So 
the feedback that you're writing isn't about the code, the code cannot change 
itself. So a person will read it and they will understand it in their way and 
interpret it.
Right. And there's so much human issues that are coming up here that I think. We 
have to put the effort in to understand what's actually happening here. And then 
as you said, have enough empathy and have enough put enough thoughts, you know, 
to, to give the right feedback. Something that I really liked as well is on your 
Twitter profile.
You have a. Pin tweet. And it says, I'm going to read it now, right? If you are 
a leader in any capacity, your primary job is no longer to be the best coder in 
the room. Your job is to invest in learning the skills you need to effectively 
communicate and grow those. You lead. The words have the potential to sit with 
people for years act accordingly.
And I think it has, I don't know, more than 5,000 to hearts and likes and things 
like that. Right. So the first thing that comes to my mind is are there any 
words that sit with you for several years? Is there something that triggered 
that very thing? Well, why do you have this word still in my head? 
**Laurie:** [00:21:19] Yeah.
So I can specifically say that, um, The trigger for writing that tweet was 
seeing multiple people talk about feedback from colleagues or superiors, um, 
that, that didn't sit well with them and had been very upsetting for them and 
kind of focusing on the negative, even if anything else is positive, if 
everything else is positive and I was.
You know, thinking through that. And I was like, you know, it's because we 
don't, we don't give our leaders the skills, um, in communication and the 
training and communication, because we continue to focus on technology as the 
only skillset that matters because we promote people because they're really good 
coders.
They're the best coder in the room. And now they should be a manager when really 
those are quite different skill sets. And the best coder in the room may be the 
person who should be manager, but they should get that job because if they're. 
Potential in management skills, not their code skills. A lot of people disagreed 
with that tweet.
Interestingly enough, they were like, I won't respect, you know, a leader who 
doesn't code better than I do. Yeah. I'm like, okay, well, that's your 
prerogative. Um, I think we can all say that something negative that has been 
said to us, you know, I speak a lot and there are conferences that give you 
feedback and it's from attendees and the attendees get to be anonymous.
And so they'll put comments and sometimes their, sometimes their comments can be 
very pointed. And it's not about the content of what I spoke about. It's about 
me as a human it's kind of that new concept. Right. Um, so I had someone just 
recently say I was obnoxious. That I was in, I'm not just speaker and every 
other comment was glowing and, you know, very kind and I felt really, really 
good.
And that was like one of the last comments on the list. And it's the only one I 
thought about for two days, the only one I thought about. And so I think, um, 
that that can Axe absolutely. Um, be telegraphed to a situation you could see 
happening with a manager or a leader where. That's all you're going to hear.
And so you need to be intentional. You need to think about how you're giving 
that feedback, um, how you are, uh, being critical if you need to be, but in a 
way that's actionable and constructive instead of just pointing out something, 
someone did wrong. 
**Michaela:** [00:23:35] So how do you deal with that? How, how do you shake 
that off?
If somebody says you're obnoxious, I mean, 
**Laurie:** [00:23:41] um, 
**Michaela:** [00:23:42] I don't know that there's 
**Laurie:** [00:23:43] any one right answer. Um, I think in the case of, you 
know, getting that a speaker feedback, I would love organizers to pay more 
attention to that and filter their feedback. I don't think they need to be 
sending those comments out without filtering them first, especially for people 
who haven't been speaking, as long as I have, if that's their first experience 
that might deter them from speaking again.
And we don't want that. There is a very. Clear line between feedback that you 
can actually do something about, and that is constructive and feedback that is 
just dismissive. So it doesn't feel good to get feedback where someone says, 
Hey, you explained this thing wrong. You use this word and it's really that work 
like that doesn't feel great, but.
It's at least actionable. You can change that for next time. You can improve. If 
someone says your voice is tricky, there's nothing you can do about that. And it 
just feels bad. And. There's no real solution to that. Some people don't even 
give it a second thought, but other people linger on that. I think a lot of 
people linger on that.
Yeah. And the best thing I can say to you is if you're looking for feedback, if 
you're looking for ways to improve, ask people, you trust, ask people to review 
your code that you know, will give you the time and the attention and the 
thoughtfulness that you deserve. Same with, uh, reviewing your blog posts or a 
talk you're giving.
And. Try not to look at, or even listen to the anonymous feedback. Those people 
don't necessarily have the time or attention or incentive to be as thoughtful or 
intentional with what they're saying. 
**Michaela:** [00:25:22] Yeah. I like also what you said about the conferences, 
right? I mean, this is a community that's actually moderated, right?
So there are conference organizers and. It's their responsibility to moderate 
the feedback. Why would you get a feedback like that? I mean, maybe they 
shouldn't censor it. So if you really wanted, they could send it to you. But as 
a default, everything, that's just, you know, hater comments. I would, I would 
filter it out and say, which is creates a toxic environment and the same for 
communities.
I have been part of several communities online now, and I think it really 
depends on. You know, the moderation of the communities. And I think if it 
starts off with, with, with a good moderation, so maybe there are one, two, 
three people that really take care of, you know, keeping the trolls out and, you 
know, setting the tone, then people understand what's accepted or not, and it 
was start to self regulate and those are wonderful places to be in.
And then you see those communities that don't have such a. Moderation. And they 
really got, you know, the can be super toxic places. Um, That, that I, yeah. I 
don't know why people, I think that most of the time, those places are for all 
the people that want to be toxic. Heck our news, for example, 
**Laurie:** [00:26:41] I 
**Michaela:** [00:26:41] mean, how often do I go there?
And then they are tearing apart a blog post, but they come and say, Oh, I didn't 
read the blog post, but you know, it's complete full of shit. Like you didn't 
read it. I mean, you start your whole conversation. But I didn't read it and 
then you're ripping it apart. It's how, so it must be really, they must be 
outliving something that makes them feel 
**Laurie:** [00:27:08] good, something like that.
Um, I said, you know, who, who just let it roll off their backs. I think a lot 
of the people who speak that way and, um, kind of let their opinions flow no 
matter what. If someone said it back to them, they wouldn't care. Um, so it's 
not always true. Right? Some of those people, um, would be deeply affected by 
it.
But, uh, for people who, you know, don't really care about other people's 
opinions, um, or don't take feedback seriously. Cause they're so overly 
confident in themselves that you know, that that person couldn't possibly be 
right. They don't really give it a second thought because if you show, um, If 
you show hurt as to something they say, they're like, well, you know, you 
shouldn't be able, you shouldn't do this job because if you can't take it, um, 
you need to be able to just move forward and have enough confidence in yourself.
And so it's different mindsets people whose personality types are different. 
It's people whose, uh, levels of empathy are very different. And. You know, I 
can't say I agree with their view, but, but there's definitely a group of people 
out there who just, you know, you can say whatever you want to them, they'll say 
whatever they want to you.
And they don't think words matter. 
**Michaela:** [00:28:30] Well, I would like to bring that conversation back to 
the workplace because well, the internet is somehow unlimited, right? So 
everybody can in some capacity contribute there, but the workplace is a little 
bit more, it's a more closed environment. So people are actually hired into that 
environment, you know?
So there's a little bit of do we actually belong together? How do we work 
together? So I think it's a, it's a more. It's a different group of people. And 
also they are face to face. There they are in real life, or if they're remote 
right in real chat or whatever. Um, but there's this concept of psychological 
safety and that describes if people on the team can take risks, interpersonal 
risks, and what are not the dare to do that.
And if they will face consequences for that, right. Let's for example, say, Your 
boss tells you something presents. A project is super energized and thinks 
that's the best thing ever. And then you listen to it. Do you really give it a 
listen? And. After an hour listening, you still, you don't understand why you 
don't understand the motivation.
You think it's strategically not a valid next stop, something like that. And 
then the question becomes, are you able to raise your concern? Right. So, and 
that's somehow what psychological safety is about. So if you feel safe, then you 
will probably say, listen, um, can you explain to me again, what's your major, 
the idea behind that?
And if you're not, you're not able to say that. Have you thought about that 
concept and you work actively with your team on that in some way? 
**Laurie:** [00:30:08] Yes. So I'm a big part of psychological safety is your 
personal situation and how much safety you have in your job security. And that, 
that has a lot of different layers.
So for example, if you are living paycheck to paycheck and, um, don't have a lot 
of economic safety. Then losing your job is incredibly impactful. And therefore, 
if you fear losing your job for speaking out your psychological safety is 
nonexistent. And, you know, even if you think you could say whatever you wanted 
at your job, you're probably less likely to, because you can't afford to be 
without them.
You check the same goes for specifically in organized groups. Um, if you do not 
have. Legal protection because you are, you, you know, identify a certain way, 
sexual orientation. Yeah. And otherwise, um, then you do not tend to have that 
same level of psychological safety and it, it doesn't really, it's not 
completely controlled by, by your workplace.
People need to be more punches and make better choices about being. Overly safe 
in their environment in making it explicitly clear that. Any team member can 
feel comfortable speaking out about anything, any way they like you don't have 
to be the person who stands up in a meeting and says to your boss, no, I don't 
agree with that.
Are there ways to give anonymous feedback? Are there ways to skip a level and 
talk to your manager's manager? If that is something you feel needs to happen, 
do you have other coworkers that you can vent to or get support from, um, who 
will listen to you and actually. Do something about it. Can they take your 
concerns with their name on it if you don't feel comfortable?
So there's a whole lot of layers there. I think in, in most cases I've had 
psychological safety in my roles because I don't have a lot of risk if I were to 
lose my job tomorrow. Theoretically, I could go find a new one and it wouldn't 
be, you know, incredibly challenging. It might be, I don't know, but, but in the 
abstract it doesn't feel like it would be at this point in my career.
Um, so I do not I'm, you know, kind of thing, Steph engineer on a team, I am not 
the manager team, but our team has just started to form up. We have now all of 
our team members and amazingly cool group of people, we think that's going to be 
a conversation that we have and something that we figure out. As we move forward 
because we're a relatively new team, we're still learning each other and 
figuring stuff out.
And it's just, it's a super important concept and it's, it's important to make 
sure everyone feels comfortable and, you know, in the abstract, I would like to 
say, yeah, I think we're doing great. But at the same time, you know, we haven't 
had something that's super tense yet. And that's when you get evidence of 
whether what you're doing is working or if you need to adjust.
**Michaela:** [00:33:05] Yeah. And that's exactly what I wanted to say because 
only in the moment that you needed. Then you realize you don't have it right. Or 
you have it, um, before it's, it's so abstract that you Oh yeah. I feel 
comfortable raising my concerns, but then if you're in a situation, right. And 
it's really about, you know, whatever, something that you haven't expected.
You know. Yeah. I really like your view on some of those things are really not 
part of your workplace. Right. There are something about the person about the 
individual themselves, right. That they bring with in the workplace. I like also 
the ideas of, you know, having some strategical way around that. Right.
So how can you give feedback anonymously, for example? I think that's a very 
good question. So. You also talked about being an egghead instructor. And I 
would like to understand a little bit more what that really means. What is an ed 
hat instructor? What do you do? And, um, yeah. And how do you prepare those 
courses and, you know, things like that.
Yeah. 
**Laurie:** [00:34:10] So, um, it had his, uh, Platform for learning. And it's a 
video platform. Um, and I became an instructor this past summer. Joel hooks. One 
of the cofounders sent me a message on Twitter and he said, Hey, Lori, do you 
want to be an instructor? And that's how I became an instructor. Um, he had read 
my blog posts and thought some of them would make good videos is my 
understanding of it at least.
Um, it's, it's a really fun thing to do. Um, I do not learn particularly well 
from videos, interestingly, but I have gotten so much feedback from people who 
had previously read my blog posts and went to watch the videos and said, Oh, I 
found the video is so valuable. That's the way I learned best. And that was my 
goal to give kind of multi-modality to the way that people could learn from the 
things that I was trying to teach.
Very cool. Yeah. In terms of topics, um, my course was kind of born out of the 
fact that I've used angular and I've used react and I've used a view. And I had 
recently been working on a project with view and I was kind of blown away by how 
great you router was. So I made a course about it. Um, Most of my other stuff is 
lessons.
So lots of JavaScript, syntax, some stuff about working with vs code. Um, some 
stuff about RX JS and specific operators. Maybe even some CSS in there I'd have 
to go back, but it's, it's normally based on what blog posts I'm writing or what 
new fun trick I just learned that I didn't know about before. 
**Michaela:** [00:35:45] So about you are completely free in deciding to do 
another video of whatever interests you.
What do you think is valuable for the audience? 
**Laurie:** [00:35:53] Whatever I want to do, I can do. 
**Michaela:** [00:35:56] Sure. Cool. That's really cool. Yeah. I actually 
learned really good with video. I know nowadays always go to YouTube first. I 
search there. If anybody has done it, I mean, it depends on the video, right? 
Some of them are just not on a level that you can actually, you know, follow it.
And then that really is annoying. But if it's a serious, for example, Hugo Hugo 
thing, I followed. I followed Mike, I think it's Mike. Um, and Mike really 
explains very well how to set up a huger site. And so I went, you know, video 
per video and I was like, well, that's, that's exactly my style. I like that. 
**Laurie:** [00:36:37] And it had, it had, has a very particular style.
Um, you'll see other video platforms that exist and, you know, they kind of do a 
set up and they say, Hey, this is what we're going to talk about today. And then 
this is what we're going to talk about in this section. And then. Start talking 
about what we're going to talk about. Um, and so you get 10 minute and send and 
you're like, wait, the silhouette answered my question.
So again, it's very succinct and to the point, and that works well for my 
teaching style. So I just, you know, I don't prime, anything you can read the 
description and the title, um, there's a little kind of code pen or code sandbox 
that will show you what it was that I did. Um, otherwise I'm diving in, I'm 
starting to code finishing it and you know, most of my videos are.
Less than a minute. I mean, it's really fast. It's quick and dirty. Okay. 
**Michaela:** [00:37:26] Yeah, I think I like that. Yeah. More so for example, I 
also do things on Pluralsight, but exactly. That's what I don't like is that 
you're, you know, you're your click somewhere and then, you know, it's the 
introduction or the introduction and I'm like, but at least you can skip it.
So, and you can, you know, make two X or something, which I always also do. But, 
um, Yeah. I like also more, if it's to the point in unit you're diving in right 
there. And, uh, but it, as you said at the beginning, um, when we were talking 
about everything should be, there should be self-contained. I also don't want to 
be left alone, you know, floating in the universe.
Because I don't understand where something comes, you know, some resources 
suddenly appear on your machine and I have no idea how you get them. Um, so it 
should be self complained, but, uh, yeah, to the point, I think that's, that's 
what I like. 
**Laurie:** [00:38:16] Yeah, for sure. 
**Michaela:** [00:38:17] Well, one of the things that I wanted to talk with you 
is about speaking, because I'm also getting back into speaking this year.
Just a few conferences because I have two kids, so I'm not going to fly around, 
uh, every month. Uh, but I see that you are almost never at home. At least it 
looks like that. If I look at your speaking website, I'm like, okay, Laurie 
lives around the globe.
Mmm. Yeah. How do you balance speaking with your data, new book? It gets B and 
M. Are you speaking engagement part of your work at Gatsby? Or how does that 
work? 
**Laurie:** [00:38:52] Yeah, so, um, a lot of the speaking engagements know 
we'll see is actually last year. Um, and, and last year was a year where I 
applied everywhere. I was interested in doing more speaking than I'd done 
before.
And it went better than I expected. And by the end of the year, I was getting a 
lot of acceptances and I still hadn't learned the word. No. Um, I didn't know 
that you could get accepted somewhere and turn them down. That was not a concept 
I grasped. I was like, why would I, I do that? You know, I applied. So obviously 
I should say yes, well, I applied without the context that I'd be at three other 
places in the same month.
So this year is going to be a little bit different. I'm scaling back quite a 
bit. The goal is to not be, um, more than one place in any given month. 
Including personal travel. There are certain months where I'm in two places, but 
I have the entirety of 2020 for me is basically, and book it out and scoped out.
Um, I think we benefit from it as a company in the sense that I get to go out 
and talk to people who use Gatsby and learn from them and get feedback from them 
directly. That's kind of what a lot of Debra that advocates are looking to do. 
They're looking to hear from users and customers in that space.
Um, for me, it's an opportunity to teach. It's an opportunity to see what is 
effective in my teaching. Kind of in a real world scenario, see people's facial 
expressions and engagement and see what's working and what's not working. And 
it's something I enjoy doing. You know, I work remote. I work from my house, so 
I like to get out every now and again, but there's definitely, definitely a 
balance that needs to be struck there.
And depending on what your job is, sometimes, you know, it is your job to go out 
and travel around the world. Sometimes that's a piece of your job. Sometimes 
that's not part of your job at all. Um, and I'm very lucky, lucky that that 
gossipy kind of gives me the latitude to make smart choices. Um, my self until 
it gets to the point where they think I've not making smart choices.
And then they say, okay, Lori, we're renting you in a little bit, but so far so 
good. 
**Michaela:** [00:40:44] So maybe one of the last topics that I want to, um, 
pick your brain about is Twitter, because you increased your Twitter following 
quite a bit over the last year. And I see you, you know, I see that you have a 
very engaged audience that you have really, you build a community.
I'm on Twitter. And I think that's something that I would like to do as well. I 
would rather have a small community than a large audience. Right. So I really 
like if people are writing back, if I, you know, hear about them, but I would 
like to understand. What Twitter means to you and how do you use Twitter to 
really engage with people?
I see that you are asking a lot of questions. Why 
**Laurie:** [00:41:27] do you do that? Yeah. I first got a Twitter account, a 
professional Twitter account because I was speaking at a conference, one of my 
first conferences and they said, you know, do you have a Twitter? And I was 
like, Well, no. And then I made one and I discovered that there was this whole 
world of tech, Twitter that I had no idea about.
I had no idea that there was this wonderful community, these content creators, 
these people, that shared resources, um, that there were people who had all 
careers, um, not based around Twitter, but. But Twitter was the vessel by which 
they shared their information, at least in part. And I was just kind of struck 
by that.
Um, I loved getting to meet and talk with people. Some of whom I have met in 
person, some of whom I still have not been considered to be good friends, but I 
loved that it was a community of people who were focused on. Talking about 
technology, teaching technology, leveraging technology, kind of running the 
gamut.
And so it led to me, you know, You know, posting about conferences I was at, or 
I'm starting to blog eventually. Yeah. You know, finding people and becoming an 
ed head instructor or a Google developer expert, or so many of the opportunities 
I've had this year is because of my presence on that platform. And I wouldn't 
say that it was explicitly intentional.
My goal was not to, you know, say, you know, get 10,000 followers. Um, Did I 
want to grow my audience because I thought I would have more of an impact. Yes. 
Did I learn very quickly that that was a very arbitrary measuring stick? 
Absolutely. So I think what you'll recognize very quickly is if you do start to 
grow your audience, Audience and engagement, like you said, are not the same 
thing.
And engagement is something you have some control over, but not actually as much 
as you think the algorithm has a lot of control over that. So for example, if I 
go on vacation and I put down my phone because I want to. I'm going to see a 
huge drop in the number of people who engage with me. And it's not because the 
people who like what I write have disappeared, it's because they're not seeing 
what I tweeted on their feet.
It's just not getting picked up. And that's okay. So, so you, and you recognize 
that like what, whether or not your stuff is seen as not really a byproduct of 
what you wrote or what you said, the question thing was born out of. Early days, 
Twitter. I had gotten to the point where I had a thousand, maybe 2000 followers.
And I said, I think there's enough people here that I could get some interesting 
data. Um, so I asked a question and I can't for the life of me, remember what 
the first one was, and I didn't expect anyone to answer. And it had like over a 
hundred responses. I was blown away and it just. Kept traveling from group to 
group to group, a bunch of people who didn't follow me were answering.
And I was like, okay, this is an effective way to interact with people. And I 
found that I just really liked coming up with interesting questions. I found 
that they made people think I found that it was a unique way of interacting on 
Twitter. Cause so many people want to be heard. Um, Or want people to hear them 
instead of wanting to listen to other people.
I think it also gives people who have a smaller platform. Um, you know, you 
happen to comment on my question and someone linked your answer will, they're 
now exposed to you as a potential person that they want to follow or learn from. 
So there's, there's lots of layers there that I thought were really interesting.
And so some months I'll go by and not ask any questions and some. Days will be, 
you know, lots of questions today. I randomly thought of a question that I 
thought it was kind of funny and silly and just seems like fun. I was curious if 
someone wrote a biography about your tech career, what would the title of it be?
And I've been laughing all morning at the response. So, you know, sometimes it 
just, you know, put a little bit of a. Levity in someone's day and sometimes 
it's, what are people working on sometimes it's, you know, how do you learn 
best? Because that directly goes to what I do. It varies. Yeah, 
**Michaela:** [00:45:34] I really like to ask questions.
So that's probably why that's so interesting to me because I'm super curious 
person and I always want to know how are they, I see the world, right? And 
especially if I have researched something for several years, then having fresh 
ideas or fresh, you know, perspective on something really, really is super 
valuable.
But. Yeah. As you said, the tutor algorithm doesn't make it really easy because 
you are asking a question and yeah, I wait for answers and then nobody answers 
and they're like, Hm.
But yeah, if people answer, I'm really super happy, always. So. Yeah. So Laurie, 
I think that we actually reached the end of my show. Do you want to, you know, 
talk about something that we haven't covered yet? No, 
**Laurie:** [00:46:20] I think we've talked about some fun stuff. The only thing 
that I would say is feel free to tweet at me.
If you think of anything you'd like to ask. I am Lorianne on tech, on Twitter. I 
write a number of blog posts about John script, web technologies, other stuff. I 
do the egghead stuff. I speak at conferences. If you ever see me in the wild, 
please come up and say, hello. 
**Michaela:** [00:46:44] Yeah, I will put everything in the show notes.
And, um, yeah, I just want to thank you for, for this really well rounded 
interview. I learned a lot today from you. Thanks for taking the 
**Laurie:** [00:46:55] time. Absolutely. Thanks so much for having me. I 
appreciate it. 
**Michaela:** [00:46:59] We enjoyed another episode after sup engineering 
unlocked. Podcast. Don't forget to subscribe. And I talk to you again in two 
weeks.
**Laurie:** [00:47:10] Bye.
