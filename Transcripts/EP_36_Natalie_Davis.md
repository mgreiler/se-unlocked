# Episode Natalie Davis

**Michaela:**  [00:00:00] Hello and welcome to the software engineering unlocked podcast. 
I’m your host, Dr. McKayla and today I have the pleasure to talk to Natalie Davis. Natalie 
just landed her first job as a software developer after recently graduating from a Bootcamp.
 
But before I start, I want to tell you more about ConfigCat - who is sponsoring today’s episode.
[ConfigCat](https://configcat.com) is a feature flag management tool, and last week I integrated it with my code review 
analytics tool. Now, with the help of ConfigCat, I can seamlessly and effortlessly switch features 
on and off in my application. They provide an intuitive user interface that allows me to set rules 
that enable or disable the feature for example based on where the user is located, or other 
characteristics that I know about the user, like the company that they work for, or the date of 
their sign-up. The promise of ConfigCat is that everyone independent of their tech skills is up 
and running within 10 minutes of training and that now everyone can tap into the sheer possibilities 
of powerful feature flag management and A and B testing. Their tool is also GDPR compliant and 
they offer a super-rich free plan, so, please check them out at configcat.com.
 
But now, back to Natalie.
Natalie is a recent bootcamp graduate that managed to get hired 
really quickly after her graduation. She's vividly sharing her knowledge on 
Twitter and started to make real waves in the deaf community within just one and 
a half years in tech, I'm really excited to have her on the show and learn how 
she experienced being in tech, our community and what she thinks about certain 
technologies, software engineering practices, and especially how she organizes 
herself to learn everything that she has to know to position herself as a 
developer in 2021.
So Natalie, I'm really happy that you're here today. Welcome to my 

**Natalie:**  [00:00:54] show. Thank you for having me. I'm excited to 

**Michaela:**  [00:00:57] be here. Yeah. I'm really, really excited. So actually 
I saw you tweeting that, you know, I just got a job and you were really happy 
about it and everybody was congratulating you. And so I really wanted to know, 
like, how did you do it?
You know, how was your job search and everything? And I know that you were a 
little bit hesitant to share it because you thought, well, it was so easy. Right 
or so quickly, uh, so quick going and that it's maybe not typical, but over my 
experience, like talking with a lot of developers, there are not really typical 
job search.
There are hard ones and long ones, and you know, some that are dragged for 
several months or even years. But there's not really a typical one. And so I 
think it's really interesting still to, to learn about, you know, how was that 
for you? Um, and also from your whole journey with intact, because I looked at 
your guitar in like 2019, the beginning, it was empty.
And then suddenly I see like one green dot and then I see more green dots and 
now it's filled with green dots all over. Right. So you're really, really active 
and yeah. And now you are one, the one, one and a half months, right? Yeah. 
Front end developer. Right. So you have your first real job. As a developer, 
you're coding for money.
And so, yeah, I would really love to hear how you experienced that journey and 
yeah. What you learned along the way, and maybe also what you can share with 
others so that they can get their foot into 

**Natalie:**  [00:02:25] the door. Yeah, you're right. When you first reached 
out, I was hesitant because we have to be careful with what we put out there in 
the world and how that impacts others.
And I didn't want anyone to see my journey and be like, Oh wow. It is super 
easy. Let me walk away from everything I have in life without giving it further 
thought. But I really appreciate that you follow back up on that conversation 
that we had and throughout some really good points and that there's still some 
value and sharing.
What helped to make me so successful. And I really have to, I know people are 
going to want some kind of like magical technical prep situation that I did, but 
I have to go back to my retail days and say that that's really what did it for 
me, the skills I learned about creating relationships and networking in a 
natural kind of organic way.
So yes, my job search itself. Like the period where I was actively sending out 
resumes was a very short period. But when I think about it, it started with, 
when I created this Twitter account that was focused on my texture. It started 
with, I was building along the way. And in the very early days, I definitely 
wasn't sure to network for a job.
I was just trying to share the fact that I was learning and my thought process 
was. I can share with the world when I'm learning, Hey, someone else might learn 
from it, but B I can make connections with people who can see the work that I'm 
putting in during this time period. So that when I am ready to kind of put 
myself out there and try to get a job, the people within my community will feel 
competent in saying no, I've seen this woman working really hard.
I know the things she's been doing. I'm willing to put myself out there and 
said, give her a shot. 

**Michaela:**  [00:04:13] Yeah. And actually that's one of the success recipes 
that I hear over and over and over. I mean, if you go back and listen a little 
bit to the shows that I put out and I asked a lot of people, like, how did you 
get that job?
How did you land that position? Right? How did you get your foot into one of the 
Fang companies? Right. And what it comes down to is, well, I worked, you know, 
to build relationships, I work to build trust that people know. You know, that 
person actually is doing great work. Right? And so the question is what can I do 
to increase my chances also?
And I think having a profile, right, being reachable, being authentic, being, 
you know, like a public with who you are, what, you know, I think that can 
really help a lot. And, and you put in the work, right? So you're there like one 
and a half years. And I see, I mean, you get to have, and it's just one, it 
doesn't, I mean, GitHub commits doesn't really mean anything, but it means 
something, it means that, you know, you put in the work to get these green dots 
on one platform, at least.
Right. And, and it means that you have, like, I looked at it and it was like 100 
over 100 followers. Right. So people are connecting with you on the platform on 
a real developer platform, and they're connecting with you on Twitter and you're 
sharing and you're, you're in connection. Right. And so I think this is really.
Yeah, really, really valuable. And what I like on your Twitter as well is that 
you're, you're sharing your journey, right? So you're sharing while I'm looking 
for jobs. Now I found a job I'm graduating now, but you also sharing some of the 
issues. For example, I recently saw that you were saying, well, I paid off my 
students loans, right?
So. You show people somehow also degraded you're going and the struggles that 
you have with that. Can you tell me a little bit about the student loans and 
where they're coming from and why you are so happy to have them, you know, Like 
gone now. 

**Natalie:**  [00:06:05] Sure. So about 20 years ago, I had zero interest in 
tech, but I was all about fashion and I enrolled in a for-profit school to study 
fashion design and.
Unfortunately, a series of life events prevented me from completing that 
process. I was about maybe six months out from getting that degree when I had to 
kind of just leave everything in my life and move across the country. So 
preventing me from continuing that education. And honestly, over the years, I 
started to, I had my put in, in retail.
I moved up there school wasn't really on my mind until. I was no longer happy 
with that career path. And I decided to go back to school. So I actually, it was 
kind of a blessing in disguise because if this private student loan hadn't 
popped up, I would have been enrolled in a university to study public policy and 
would have had nothing to do with tech.
But I found out about this private student loan. And then I wasn't even aware 
that it doesn't show up like. I regular government backed student loan would, it 
was just floating out there in the Netherlands. And it actually prevented me 
from getting my transcripts from that for-profit school. They told me that they 
wouldn't release my transcripts unless I paid that $15,000 in full.
And I definitely didn't have $15,000 in full. So at that time, I just kind of 
put that aside and started looking for other options to. Do a career switch. And 
that's when I found out about boot camps and things like that, and wound up on 
this path. So I'm grateful. But once I went ahead and found my first job, I was 
thinking that perhaps education wasn't over for me that maybe I'd like to learn 
a few more things.
So I, I called up that particular private student moments in a collection 
agency. So I called them and asked them, would they be willing to settle? And 
they settled for about 90% of that student loan. So I was able to pay it off and 
now I can, re-enroll in a traditional educational path. 

**Michaela:**  [00:08:17] Yeah, that's really, really cool.
So I'm really happy for you to, you know, I think this is something that you are 
having on the back of your mind as well. Right? So it's like something that 
makes you happy and you cannot, you know, you cannot go about life freely or as 
lightly probably. And so I can imagine that this now really feels amazing, but 
how, how did you come from, you know, political.
Studies right to the tech bootcamp. So how did that happen? How did that 
transition go? And you know, like, yeah. What made the switch that you said, 
well, I'm going to do that. Now I'm a program. I'm a software engineer. 

**Natalie:**  [00:08:52] It started with something that I saw on Twitter. It was 
a few years ago and they were talking about.
Baked in by us as an algorithm and how that was affecting the black community as 
well as other marginalized identities. And that for me, was a place where I can 
step in. I can be loud, I can shake tables, I can kick down doors and make room 
for others while still doing work that I felt was challenging and could have an 
impact on the lives.
So that's what really started me getting interested in tech and in general. And 
honestly, I intended to begin my career as a data scientist, but then I saw the 
pre-course work for data science, and I thought that maybe web development would 
be a better place for me to start not going to lie. I got a little intimidated 
by some of that coursework.

**Michaela:**  [00:09:48] Yeah. Okay. I can see. And so how does that work for 
bootcamp now? And I think you attended London school, right? So how does that 
work? How do you, like, do you have like to do a test that you can actually 
start that? Are you tested before? Or can anybody started? What's your 
commitment there? Like how long does it normally take?
Is it always like fixed? I really don't know a lot about longer school. 
Obviously. I read a little bit about it, but I would like to. Yeah. Yeah. From 
you your experience, how that was for you and yeah. And what you can, you 
recommend it, would you do it again? 

**Natalie:**  [00:10:21] So full disclaimer, the process for entry to him to, 
well, it's different.
And I don't know exactly what it looks like now, but when I attended, there was 
some pre-course work that was free and available to the public. And it included 
things like JavaScript on the mental, so functions and variables, those kinds of 
things. I really like. High level overview, just to see if you have the 
propensity for this.
And then once you completed that self-paced pre-course work. You took a kind of 
a coding challenge to see if you could attend Lambda school. If you were able to 
pass the coding challenge and you were able to enroll into lamps. So that was my 
pathway in, it was challenging not going to lie, but I had bought a new 
computer.
So because I bought that new computer, that was the pressure on me. Like, you 
can't give up, you can't, you can't have wasted this Mac book pro money. So that 
was my motivation to really keep going. And honestly, I just fell in love with 
what it meant to solve. A co to solve the challenge of going from, like, I don't 
know what any of this is to, well, I get it and I can do something with this.
So that's what you got me there. In terms of the experience of going through 
Lambda school. I had an absolutely wonderful experience and I know that that's 
not. A one-to-one mirror for everybody who's attended, even for everybody who 
attended. When I attended, when the program was structured in a way that 
everyone had a team lead and I have to admit my team lead is what made my Lambda 
school experience particularly phenomenal.
His name is CJ he's on Twitter. Also find him and follow him. And he was 
amazing. CJ was really. He, he put in the work. So he understood the 
assignments. We were giving the concepts that we were supposed to have, but he 
also cared about us as students. So there was never a time where I couldn't come 
to CJ and get help.
And because he cared about people, he was also intuitive enough to know that 
oftentimes all I needed to hear was slow down your movement. Your mind is moving 
quicker than you are, and that's your problem. So I'm particularly thankful to 
him. 

**Michaela:**  [00:12:35] Yeah. Yeah. I think even, yeah, different companies, 
it's the people often that, you know, make or break your experience there.
Right. So you can be at a large corporation like Microsoft and you can have like 
a blessing and like a wonderful experience. And then you can have like a 
horrible experience if you're in another team. Right. And I think this is true. 
For most companies, unfortunately. Right. But it's always good to also have like 
people that really, you know, make your day and make your year and maybe help 
you progress in life.
So I definitely going to link him in the show notes and then everybody can go 
and follow and also follow you. Of course. And yeah. So th that's really good to 
hear. So how does that work? You have to know a little bit about programming 
before. It seems like two to pass a test at coding challenge. How. How much 
preparation do you need?
Like, do you need a month to get, you know, to that point to be able to do such 
a coding challenge or do you need more, how freaky is that? And 

**Natalie:**  [00:13:33] yeah. Yeah. I think the, the kind of entry test that. I 
took what it did. It took about a month, month and a half to prepare for it. Now 
I don't believe I could be wrong.
I could be misspeaking, but I don't believe that they had that same entry test. 
I think what they've done is they've taken some of those basic concepts that 
were included in that pre-chorus work and integrated it into. The regular 
coursework, but that being said, I would say anyone who is considering going to 
a bootcamp or studying anything anywhere to immediately, once they've decided 
that they're going to do it, start going to work, get on free code camp.
Grabbing you then me start. I mean, what's the worst that's going to happen. 
You're going to be ahead of pace to where you need to be. I think that's a good 
thing because it moves so quickly. So I went through the program as a student, 
but I also acted as a team lead and a section leader. So I went through the core 
curriculum about four times.
I went through at once as a student, twice as a team lead and then once as a 
section leader. And so when I went through it as a student, Everything was 
moving so quickly and everything was brand new. So. There were, I was just 
trying to keep my head above the water. I was just trying to keep swimming and 
get the next assignment done and study on my own when I could to strengthen what 
I needed to start.
But when I went through as a team, because I had already gone through that, 
trying to keep my head above the water, I was able to catch so much nuance and. 
The small things that didn't seem like they mattered to me when I was going 
through as a student that I could absolutely see the value in as a team, not to 
mention, I had 12 students who were turning to me to help them understand the 
concept, which means I had to explain them 12 different ways, often 12 different 
times until it clicked in their head.
And I honestly think that that's what gave me the real foundation of what was 
able to, what made me able to succeed. 

**Michaela:**  [00:15:29] Yeah, I can totally see that. And I think it's similar 
to what people say about blogging, right? Why it's so important and so great if 
you're blogging, because you have to explain the concepts that you think, you 
know, again, I didn't write them down or teaching somebody like, so when I went 
through university, I also work very closely with one person.
And so we had this arrangement that I was helping, you know, that person always 
prepare for the tests. But he was really beneficial for me as well, because I 
had to explain very detailed and really understand, you know, what I was when I 
was just reading all my life like, Oh, I know it, but then I have to explain it.
Right. You're like, Oh, maybe I didn't understand that particular thing here is 
that. A normal way of doing those boot camps. I can't imagine it's not. Right. 
So only a small percentage of the students are actually working as team leads 
and helping others again. Do you say like, is it voluntarily, do you say, like, 
I want to do that and then you can become a 

**Natalie:**  [00:16:24] team lead.
Well at the time it was a paid position at Atlanta. Now, unfortunately, they've 
done away with TLS and I think they've done themselves a great disservice by 
removing that vital piece of the puzzle, but it was a paid position. It wasn't 
paying much. It, it was definitely. So again, I talked about how I bought the 
Mac book pro, so now I have to, well, I walked away from a retail job that was 
paying me $65,000 a year, which.
That's not rich money, but combined with my husband's income, we were 
comfortable. I walked away from that to take the $13 an hour teeny business. I 
also had to really pour myself in it because now. I gave up my career for this 
at this point, like I have to make this work. So yeah. So yeah, unfortunately 
not around any longer though.

**Michaela:**  [00:17:12] Okay. Yeah, that's true. I think that's really 
unfortunate and I think it can help, as you said, right. It can help your 
students. They learn more and if they even paid, even if it's a little bit of 
money, right. So when I was in university, I was also like in the first year, I 
wasn't as. I wasn't fit enough to, you know, work in it, to be honest.
Right. So I did other stuff, like whatever I could do. Right. But after a year, 
I really transitioned from what I have been doing outside to do what I'm also 
learning at school, because that really helped me get a better foundation and 
really advanced my skills. Right. So when you're still working, you know, like I 
came from an art school and if you're still working in the art section, which is 
interesting, but yeah.
It didn't really help. You know, I felt like every hour that I'm spending, I'm 
really spending just for the money because I'm interested in something else. 
Right. And so allowing students to actually do something that, um, helps them 
not only gain a little bit of money, but also, you know, strengthens their 
skills and give them some, some experience.
I think that's really, really powerful. 

**Natalie:**  [00:18:14] Yeah. Yeah. So obviously my team lead had a huge impact 
on me. And then some of the students who ITL four had told me that. And like you 
hate because no one likes to toot their own horn. And like, I, I think. Anyway, 
they tell me that at least a few of them have told me that they would have left 
Lambda long ago.
If I hadn't been there TL and the students who I did TL for, particularly when I 
was still in school, like I was often acting as their TL, especially when they 
lost it. 30 hours because they needed someone to turn to them. Someone's help 
them understand. And I really enjoyed that role. It was something that I would 
probably volunteer time to do even now.

**Michaela:**  [00:18:59] Yeah, I can imagine. So, so now you are graduating 
Lander school. How do you, how do you start your job search? Right. What kind of 
roles do you feel like prepared for? Do you feel like prepared for a normal 
developer role? Or do you go like for juniors? Do you want to do an internship? 
What's your way of thinking at that point?
And yeah. How did you, how did you go about that? 

**Natalie:**  [00:19:23] It's challenging, right? Because in this industry, 
there's always a bit of imposter syndrome. So it's challenging to put you out 
the South out there and say, Hey. I can do these things now. I felt definitely 
prepared for a front end role. Any junior role I felt I could honestly compete 
with.
There was some back and forth with myself with, are you really just a junior? 
You've put in a lot of work, perhaps you shouldn't be limiting yourself to such 
junior roles. And I did have conversations with a couple of companies that the 
role wasn't. Necessarily a junior role. And I really appreciate that those 
companies were completely willing to invest in me.
They were using tech stacks that I had never touched, but they could see 
something in me that assured them that I would be able to jump in and. Kind of 
get my hands dirty and do what was necessary in order to take those roles. Now I 
did ultimately decide on a junior role. I think that it was a good decision as 
much as I may conceptually or theoretically understand certain things, doing 
them in practice is not the same thing.
So I'm glad that I didn't put myself in a position as to where, like there would 
be a bunch of unnecessary and undue pressure to perform. At a level when this is 
my first tech job, I did consider apprenticeships. I was really interested in 
the Twitter apprenticeship, and I thought that I had a really good chance.
I had a recommendation from a former Twitter apprentice who was now a software 
engineer there. I scored perfectly on the coding assessment. I couldn't find out 
that there were hundreds of people who scored perfectly on the coding 
assessment. And unfortunately, Twitter just didn't see it for me. And that's 
fine because ultimately what that meant is.
I just shouldn't have been going after apprenticeships. I should be going after 
my first role, which is the way I took it. It hurt a little bit feeling hurt 
because that was the dream role of women. Right? I mean, Twitter, Twitter, 
community tech community has carried me through this journey when I lost my team 
leads.
I plucked team leads from Twitter. Mark has been, I'm going to have to find his, 
I can't remember his last name right now, which is horrible, but I will find it 
and make sure you have it because that man extended himself jumped on video 
calls. When I was going through computer science and trying to figure out what a 
binary search tree was.
And. All of these things that I had never understand, he really carried me 
through that program as well as just the general Twitter timeline. So with all 
those things combined, that just meant Twitter for me was the dream job. But I 
don't believe in like staying rooted in disappointment. I don't believe that 
one, no means anything in the grand scale of life.
I think that a really, uh, kind of a benefit of coming to. Tech as a second 
career, a little bit later in life, like I've had enough life experience that 
one, no, especially from Twitter. Cause like who starts their career at a place 
like Twitter, that's not reasonable to have that expectation. And it was truly 
amazing.
So I got that news that I didn't get the Twitter apprenticeship on a Friday on 
Sunday. I put a tweet out that, you know, Was it wasn't even at helped me find a 
job tweet. It was a, I just updated my get hub, reading me about to really 
launch this job search kind of sweet and shout out to the Twitter community.
It got reshared so much before I knew it by Monday. I think I had three 
interviews set up for that week, three really strong possibilities. And I 
finally wound up getting the offer from Fox chalk company where I'm at now, 
maybe a week and a half later. 

**Michaela:**  [00:23:16] Wow. Yeah, that's really cool. And so what, what is 
expected, like what did the company ask you to do?
How many hoops did you have to jump through? Was that something like very often 
you hear those really horrible stories and honestly, I experienced those over 
and over again. Like, it doesn't matter how, how long you're in the industry. 
They still like, Oh, can you do this and that? And can you improve that?
And, you know, over here, And how was that for you? Was that actually the same? 
Did you feel like it's really like you're tested? 

**Natalie:**  [00:23:48] So for, to, so of the three roles that I feel like were 
really strong possibilities, one was you just had to build something using 
flatter and include a text. The second was a take-home test.
And in fact, that take-home test, I, because I was doing like three at the same 
time, I wound up emailing them because they were using like.net and see, and 
some other things that I had no idea about. So I emailed them like, Hey, just so 
you know, this is where I'm at. I'm probably gonna need a little more time 
considering that to dig into these languages and find out what's going on.
They immediately responded to me. Hey, we just, I want to give you a chance to 
shine. You go ahead and use whatever with your framework you're comfortable with 
to complete it. So that was wonderful. And then the place where I wound up 
accepting was just, here's a Figma file. Make it happen. Like I was fully 
expecting to be white boarding.
I had done months of preparing for it. My poor husband. I had him here at my 
board, like explaining to him algorithm, shout out to that man. Cause he sat 
there and really pretended to be interested in the thing. So yeah. Again, 
another aspect of my particular journey that I feel is atypical, but I'm really 
thankful to have no one sent me through.
Anything ridiculous at all. 

**Michaela:**  [00:25:17] And I think really it's important to share that. I 
think it's so important to share this good stuff, right. To also show that there 
are companies out there where you don't have to jump through hundreds of hoops. 
Right. And prove yourself. I mean, I totally understand that, you know, people 
want to know what your abilities are because it's a, it's a big investment for 
them.
And especially if the company is smaller, right. The bigger the investment is, 
but yeah. I sometimes feel like this human aspect is really forgotten like that 
we are all humans and that nobody wants to be like tested and dissected and 
whatnot. Right. So, and I like that as well, as you said, well, we want you to 
shine.
So I was interviewing quite a few people recently in the last year. Two month 
four positions at the startup that I'm currently consulting with. And so I tried 
to help them, you know, get their, their first engineers and their engineering 
team settled. And this is really what I wanted to do as well. I wanted to put 
people in the position that they can shine.
So I'm not interested in what you don't know or find out if, you know, Like from 
these 20 questions that I have, how many can I is core that you don't know? 
Right. This is exactly the opposite. What I want to do. I want to have give 
people the possibility to shine with their personality, but also with their 
skillset and with their passion and what they're interested in.
Right. And so, yeah. When I designed the questions and the whole interview 
process, I was always thinking on how can I make it less gatekeeping? And so I 
think it's really important that people also share their really good 
experiences. And maybe that also encouraged us to people that are in a 
privileged position.
To walk away. Right. Not everybody can do that, but sometimes you can just 
Kuwait and say, no, not with me, not today, you know, not you and tried 
somewhere else. Right. Not everybody can do it. I totally understand. But if you 
can, and if we know, and we hear the stories, you know, of good experiences, I 
think this is a very.
Powerful. Very strong message as well. There are others out there, you know, 
that that value you and your experience and your time and your skillset. Right. 
So, yeah. So I think it's really good that, that this is how it worked for you. 

**Natalie:**  [00:27:32] Yeah. Yeah. I was certainly relieved and I think you're 
right. I think that there are a lot of people out there who understand that.
The interview process is kind of broken and are really working hard to make sure 
that no one has to prove themselves by doing things that they will likely never 
do in their day-to-day role on a whiteboard in front of a panel of people 
judging them. 

**Michaela:**  [00:27:57] I also think that it has to do a little bit, like with 
this there's like this victim cycle, like you went through a such a hard time.
Process and had to prove yourself. And now you feel like you're superior because 
you know, you manage to get through it. And so now you want to expose the other 
people to the same scrutiny. 

**Natalie:**  [00:28:16] Yeah. Mapping play out a lot in society. I mean the 
whole canceling student loan debt. Oh, yeah. Lots of things. And yeah, don't be 
that hurt.
And if you've gone through something horrible, you should never want anyone else 
to unnecessarily experience 

**Michaela:**  [00:28:31] that. Exactly. Yeah. That's that's exactly. And these 
are like the two T mindset and I sometimes believe people, people don't even 
know that there's the other possibility that you could just, you know, Try to 
prevent people to go through the same pain that you had.
Right. And you could learn from it, and this could actually be really your 
superpower. You went through this shitty, whatever. Right. And now you help 
people not to experience that. I think that would be really a cool thing. And 
yeah, you're right with the student loan. It's the same. Right. And sometimes 
for me, it's really mind blowing.
How can you wish for others that they will pay forever and only because you paid 
forever and like, Well, you should actually know that it's not good. 

**Natalie:**  [00:29:12] Absolutely thing to put in there in terms of, if you're 
hiring, hiring for a front engine and engineer, and you're giving them like 
graph problems to solve on a whiteboard, are you really filtering for the best 
candidate to do the work that needs to be done?
You're not you're. So you've now made this front end engineer spent all of these 
months prepping for these kind of algorithm questions, which means they're 
probably not touching the front end things that they do nearly as much. So 
you're just. Putting yourself at a disadvantage. 

**Michaela:**  [00:29:46] Yes. True. Yeah, totally agree.
So one of the things that's really interesting to me and they asked quite a few 
of my guests are engineering practices. So testing code reviews, how you write 
code, maybe some agile methodologies. Do you do stand ups and especially 
seasoned engineers like that have been in industry for a long time or have seen 
different.
Places and work at different places. I asked them what they think about best 
practices, but I am super curious about, you know, how do you see that? Like, 
how do you decide something is a best practice? Do you read it on free code camp 
that people say this is a best practice? And then you think it is a best 
practice?
Or, I mean, I, I imagine that if you're studying at a company. That everything 
seems like a best practice. Everything that everybody is doing is like, Oh, this 
is how things are supposed to be done. And so, yeah, I really would love to hear 
your thoughts on that. And how do you, you know, get these nuances of, you know, 
what's the right way for you to do it for a team to do it.
And how do you prepare yourself to also be knowledgeable in that 

**Natalie:**  [00:30:56] area? That's really challenging, especially when you're 
just entering it because you made a good point. Like, I don't have any basis of 
comparison for anything that's being done at my particular job, but I will say 
one of the instructors, Atlanta school is not with them any longer, but his name 
was Louis Hernandez.
I never had him as my instructor, but as a team lead, I worked with him. And so 
he would do these development hours for the team leads and kind of give us. Just 
some tips and best practices. And one of the things that he taught me that 
really struck with me is a best practice is just someone's opinion.
And that doesn't mean that you discount it. It doesn't mean that there isn't 
some validity to it, but it is at the end of the day and opinion and 
understanding that. Made it a little bit easier to kind of suss through, is this 
really a best practice? But again, I will ask Twitter, like, Hey, I saw this 
thing done.
Didn't feel right to me. What do you guys think? Like ask other people, talk to 
other people who had been working in the industry longer than you. You're going 
to get a variety of responses. And most of them won't line up one to one, but 
you should be able to get a picture almost I've been diabetic. I'm like, where 
are they all.
On the same page yet. And that's kind of where you're at now in terms of, at my 
job, how do I determine the best practice? I asked my senior engineer if he says 
to do it that way. And I don't want to say just if he says to do it that way, 
then that's how it's done. Because there was an instance where we were doing 
something away.
I presented a. Solution. That was completely different than what we were doing, 
but it made our experience easier. It got us to what we were actually trying to 
achieve, and he was open to that. So if something's obviously has room for 
improvement, then sure. Bring that up. But if it's about a file structure or 
something like that, and he says, that's how it's done, then that's the best 
practice.
Because at the end of the day, you got to satisfy your boss, right? 

**Michaela:**  [00:33:00] Yeah. And I think it also has married to learn from 
others. They have been maybe lower than you in this industry have seen maybe 
something else. So I think we should always be open to learn from each other. 
Right. So even as a senior or a very, very senior presenter, you can learn from 
somebody that just starting in tech, because they might have seen something else 
or even, you know, the, the experience that you made in retail.
They could shape your understanding and maybe something wonderful comes out of 
it. Right then. So maybe you are coming up with a new design patterns. There 
haven't been like many introduced lately, right? So I think it's really 
important to be really open and learn from each other. But also, as you said, be 
critical and reflective of this is actually work for me.
And there are definitely best practices that are not working for everybody. And 
I think. One of the things that I hear very often, and I'm just thinking, well, 
this wouldn't be working for me on a day to day basis. As for example, mop 
programming or assembled programming. Like we're, there's a whole team of people 
working at the same time and I'm like this wouldn't for my personality.
I would just be totally overwhelmed with all these people around all the time. 
I'm not saying it's not, it's probably good, right? Yeah. To do it. And for the 
code and for the quality and for Tinbergen. Perfect. But for me personally, I 
would be burned like after a week. I'm like, I have to quit. I can't do that 
anymore.
Right. Are you really like, if I'm, if I have my quiet time and I can think 
about, and it's just like, it charges my batteries again. And so I think this is 
some of those practices that we hear and people read off them. Some people 
really love them. And then I think some others, like me included, I cannot 
envision to do that.
Like. I can do it like once a week, right. No problems, but I have to prepare 
myself like this is not a time that my energy goes not only to the programming 
and thinking about the productivity thing, but really to just be surrounded by 
people all the time. So, yeah. 

**Natalie:**  [00:35:03] Because I thought about it. And I'm thinking about like 
how it may sound.
When I say I just listened to my senior dad, I want to point out that I also ask 
why, and it's not a petulance kind of like, well, why are you doing it like 
that? Or me waiting to prove that that's wrong. But it's to understand, because 
you made a really good point, especially when someone's been doing this longer, 
they run into things that you been seen on your five component app that you've 
been building.
So make sure to understand the why and not just blindly accept that the best 
practices are a, B and C. Yeah, 

**Michaela:**  [00:35:40] exactly. I mean, understanding the reasons I think is 
so important because otherwise you're also best practices are very often 
extremely intertwined with the environment. You know, what kind of software are 
you building under?
Which circumstances are you building them? What business goals do you have? 
Right. All of that actually influences the, the practices that you should. Plays 
into your development process, right. And how you should structure that thing. 
And if you don't understand the why you will just take it like a black box and 
apply it to every situation, you know, and in many situation it will be the 
wrong choice to do it, right.
It doesn't matter if it's test driven development or code reviews. There are a 
lot of ruins is how to do them. And there is also the right and the wrong time 
to do them in a certain type. And it has, you know, it's really, it's 
interconnected with the development team, all already constraints that you have 
at your company and everything.
Right? So the why is super important as you say. So there are two questions that 
I really want to ask you. One is about the tech stack. So how did you choose it? 
I imagine that maybe it has to do with lameness. Cool. And because they are 
teaching that this is how you ended up having that tech stack or, you know, it's 
JavaScript, no dried react and so on.
But did you choose the London school because it had the right tech stack or was 
it really you choose Lumberg Cook's tool because you felt like this is the right 
school for you and they had the tech stack. So which, which way 

**Natalie:**  [00:37:09] did it go? So I chose Lambda school because. It came 
well recommended to me from a mentor I had made contact with through Twitter.
And she was hearing that Lambda was putting out kind of the best bootcamp 
graduates. So it was definitely my tech stack came because I chose Lambda. I do 
think that there's going to be value in learning other tech stacks, but I want 
to make sure that I have a deep enough understanding of. JavaScript, which is 
the entire basis of everything that I do before I start, like, I'd rather have 
really deep knowledge there than broad knowledge everywhere and not know 
anything really well.
So I absolutely intend to kind of reach out and explore other things. But right 
now my priority is just getting really good at what I already know. 

**Michaela:**  [00:37:58] Yeah, I think that's a good strategy. I think it's the 
same good strategy as starting with a junior position because you can advance 
really quickly. So if you, if you're in that junior position and you learn and 
you grow, then you can quickly go from junior to not a junior position anymore 
and further, right.
But if you skip one step and then you're struggling and then you have to put 
fires out here and there all the time, because you just have to make sure that 
you're up to date with what you have to do. I think then you cannot strive that 
much. Right. So I think even that could be as slower. Culverts progression, but 
it also depends on your team and obviously the company and everything, right?
So this is, this is not universally true, but I think in, in many cases it's a 
good staff, especially if you are really new to the industry, right. I'm 
definitely not the person that says don't shoot, you know, a little bit higher 
and try, because especially later on people, sometimes, especially women. Don't 
dare right.
To shoot one higher, which I also think at that point, you should do it like go 
for the next role. I think skip one and then just try it out. But I think, 
especially at the beginning to get this foundation, I think it's a good step to, 
you know, get it ready and then grow quickly. Yeah. 

**Natalie:**  [00:39:11] I think you bring up a really good point.
And that's why I was initially considering an apprenticeship in the first place, 
because I thought an apprenticeship would be perfect in that I would feel more 
comfortable making mistakes, which might allow me to be a little bit more bold 
than I would as a junior. Now it didn't work out that way and I'm glad about it.
And I'm glad I've landed in a place where I feel comfortable that I can make a 
mistake and it's not going to be held against me. But I think you make a really 
good point. It can be very tempting. To, especially in the beginning go to super 
as high as you can. But I think, and this is something that I've learned, not 
just in tech, but in life, in general, for some of us, I'm one of those people.
There's a tendency to Excel and get the next promotion really quickly. And 
that's what happened to me in retail. About every six months I got a promotion 
and I worked through it and it was fine, but I can tell you as a store manager 
who had only been in retail a couple of years, there were definitely times where 
I had to really rely on the people working under me, who had been in retail for 
10 or 15 years and had seen these things that I'd never seen.
So I'm also, I'm trying to be ambitious without being too ambitious. I don't 
want to move too quickly. So, yeah, I think you made a really good point about 
that 

**Michaela:**  [00:40:32] maybe to also wrap our interview up. What would you 
say, especially for people that are noticed one to go or get into tag or get 
their first job or making these decisions?
Right. Very early on, like. What technology stack, what school, you know, what, 
where should I apply? What was your, you know, and you said it a little bit, bit 
fitter, right? Like building those relationships was really important. Is there 
something else that you think people should do that sets them up for success?

**Natalie:**  [00:41:03] You're going to have to study hard. You're going to 
have to be willing to be knocked completely on your back in tears, in a puddle 
on the floor, because you don't understand anything you're going to have to be 
able to get up from that, understand that that's normal and. Keep going in terms 
of which school, which bootcamp, which texts that I have no opinions on that 
because it's going to look different for each person.
You have to make the decisions that are right for you, but no matter where you 
choose to go, you are going to have to put in more than you expect to put in. 
You. Won't be able to just show up during your scheduled class time and then 
move on with your day. And. Think that you have done enough in order to be 
successful, but you also have to find balance because many of us, myself 
included, went through periods where we completely lost ourselves in the 
studying and the attempting to reach the next milestone.
You don't want to find yourself in burnout and that's where you will lay in 
there. So you're going to have to work hard, but you're going to have to know 
when to listen to your body and your mind when it's telling you it needs a 
break. And that will often be the thing that gets you past the block or so.

**Michaela:**  [00:42:23] Yeah, I think that's absolute fantastic advice. And do 
you know what, what was really interesting for me during my studies? I'm also a 
person that, you know, if I, I, first of all, I love studying, I really love 
learning. I love like I'm a little bit addicted to it. Like 

**Natalie:**  [00:42:38] it's why I'm trying to enroll in college again.

**Michaela:**  [00:42:41] Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. And that's why I have been 
at school so long, but. What I also saw is that I performed the best, really the 
best grades and, you know, the best ideas, creativity flew when I was studying a 
little bit less and having more fun, you know, I mean, I was never like the over 
party person, like never studying and always partying.
I was more the other person. Right. But it was studying all the time and they 
were partying, but. But I added like a little bit partying to the mix, like 
meeting other people, socializing and maybe not doing, you know, some of the 
homeworks and not studying or not, or night or something. I actually performed 
better at my tests, which I found pretty interesting.
And there was like, no good explanation at that time, but obviously it has to do 
that. You're rested that you're balanced, right? That you're getting other input 
that your mental models and your perception and your perspective are enhanced. 
And you're not just like this, you know, book smart person. And so, yeah, I 
think you're totally right work and study.
Part, but also don't forget like everything around, which is really valuable. 
Like your relationships, your family, your friends, you should really cherish 
them and make sure we spend enough time. 

**Natalie:**  [00:43:57] Yeah. Yeah. 

**Michaela:**  [00:43:59] Yeah. Okay. So Natalie, thank you so much for being on 
my show. It was really a pleasure to talk to you today.
I learned a lot. It was really nice and the thing is so much. Well, 

**Natalie:**  [00:44:09] thank you for having me. I really appreciate being 
invited onto the podcast. Yeah. 

**Michaela:**  [00:44:14] Thank you so much. Okay, bye bye. Bye. Bye. 

**Natalie:**  [00:44:19] I'm a waver. 

**Michaela:**  [00:44:21] I, me too. I bet you've actually, I think every 
episode I'm leaving, so that was good.
