# Episode 49 with Florin Pop

[00:00:00] 
**Michaela:**   Hello and welcome to the software engineering unlocked podcast. 
I’m your host, dr. mackalya and today I have to pleasure to talk to Florin Pop.

But before I start, let us talk about this extremly long, and very unexpected break. 
You must have believed that I might never come back. But thankfully, that’s not 
the case. 

In fact, I actually came back bigger and multiplied… Yeah, from today on, I’m not 
doing those interviews alone anymore, but I have a little intern for the next 
couple of months - which is sitting right in my belly. So far, the intern has not 
been very helpful I have to say - instead, I got horrible morning sickness, which 
is also called hyperemesis. Well, that’s also the reason why there was this long, 
unannounced and unexpected break. But I had a good talk with the intern and put it 
right on a performance improvement plan, and yeah, it seems we are slowly getting better.

So, we both started working on new episodes for you again.
During this break, I also decided that it is time to shake things up a little bit. 
I will start to experiment with the format and content of the podcast.

I have a couple of ideas that I will try out and see how you like them. So, stay 
tuned for new episodes! But now back to Florin and his insight into content creation.

Florin is a web developer that started building websites in 2013 and worked 
many years as a successful freelancer. I know Florin from his super popular 
YouTube channel, and he's funny and inspiring on the stream. He's dedicated to 
grow and learn in public. And what fascinates me the most is this Florin 
always is humble, honest, and very, very kind.
So I can't be happier to have Florin here with me. Florin, welcome to the show.

[00:00:34]

**Florin:**  Thank you very much. And thank you very much for the kind words 
that oh 
[00:00:39] 

**Michaela:**    yeah. I've been following for, for quite some time and I'm really 
always impressed , . It feels very authentic. If you do a YouTube channel, if 
you do your challenges and how you share what you're learning.
And also sometimes you're vulnerable, right? If people, you know, online can be 
a rough place, you probably know that. And, and I think it's really important to 
also show that, you know, words can harm and can. Yeah, you can feel it. And I 
like that, that you shared that. Like, if, if you are deep down, you're sharing 
it.
If you have like success, you're sharing it. And I always feel like you're very, 
very honest with your journey and not everything is like super fine. And, you 
know, I'm writing three blog posts and now I'm famous and make the most money or 
something. Right. So yeah, I always say, give and take, 
[00:01:29]

**Florin:**  right? Yeah, exactly.
So this is how life works. You have successes and failures and some days you're 
doing great and other days it's not so great. And I like to share that and to, 
because. I always, I'm thinking of people who are following me. I want them to 
learn the most after my experience. This is one of my values to share what I'm 
learning and alongside my journey.
There are also failures and I'm messed up a lot of things. Usually people are 
kind of afraid to share that because you have to be vulnerable about those. But 
if you don't do that, especially as a influencer quote it just sends the wrong 
message that everything's perfect, but in reality, not everything is perfect all 
the time.
It's just a continue grind of doing your best every day. And sometimes you mess 
up things and that's okay because that's how we learn by messing things up and. 
[00:02:34] 

**Michaela:**    Yeah, it's true. Like, it's really easy to say for others always. 
Oh, it's, it's totally fine. It, I think they are. They're also forgiving for 
artists very much, but not so much for ourselves if you're messing up.
Right. And you're afraid to, to show that things are not. Not going as well, or, 
you know, we made this big goal. You make this big goal, right? You said like 
100 K you didn't say many how many days. Right. But you said 100 K so it's a 
list, but you know, like, can you fail with that? How would you say it? Would 
you say, oh, it didn't work out or, you know, and actually.
[00:03:09]

**Florin:**  I like to create big goals for myself. This is probably the first 
challenge where I didn't have a deadline for, for it. For example, 365 years 
days of running everyday, I did 100 projects in 100 days. I did, when I started 
my YouTube journey, the first challenge was 31 videos in 31 days. Then I did the 
frequent camp curriculum in a month.
So everything kind of was kind of had a deadline because. Those are called smart 
goals. They have that deadline aspect of it. The reason why I didn't add the 
deadline to this new challenge, which I'm currently working on going from zero 
to 100 K I mean revenue is because I wanted, I, I just feel that there are so 
many variables.
I don't know. And I didn't want to put a lot of pressure on myself, although I 
kind of have a deadline of one year, 1.5 years, roughly, I don't want to go 10 
years with it. And I'm sure that I, so I have kind of a hidden deadline for 
myself. Oh, I don't make it public. Although in some of the streams, we talked 
about it when we kind of decided, okay, how many projects I should work on?
What should they do? And what are kind of the deadlines just to see, just to 
keep track of what's happening. And I think that's, for me, that's highly 
motivating because this is how I worked in the past couple of years. I just. 
These kinds of challenges got me out of my comfort zone. Also the public aspect 
where I share on, in public, what I'm doing is what makes me kind of have to do 
it because now people watch me and, you know, I, I it's okay to fail.
But like, The challenges, which I'm doing. I try not to make them super, super 
hard. Like, I don't know, make 10,000 pushups in a day for 100 days, you know? 
But rather make 10 pushups every day. For one of the days, it's more about the 
consistency aspect than having crazy, crazy, crazy goals. I might do that, but 
like with shorter, like 10 days or something, Yeah.
So it's going 
[00:05:31] 

**Michaela:**    into the building. I have it building thing, right? So I say tiny 
habits are actually better for, in the long run. 
[00:05:37]

**Florin:**  Right? Exactly. So it's not about doing super, extremely hard 
things, but then just doing something which is relatively easy to do, it's just 
a matter of being consistent with it.
And it will over time change. Change an area of your life. Like when it was for 
running, I lost weight that period, then I felt much energized and yeah, 
building the projects have learned stuff along the way. So it's just being the 
consistency. Yeah. 
[00:06:08] 

**Michaela:**    Yeah. And so, for example, we're coming back to the running 
because I also follow that one.
I'm following a lot of things, but so you lost weight and then after the 
challenge, do you keep up with the things, do you still run daily or several 
times a week? And did you know, did the, the way you go up again or, and you 
share that as well? Like if it's setbacks, for example, 
[00:06:31]

**Florin:**  Yeah. So when it comes to weight, my weight journey II, it's kind 
of rough because I did this like several times in my life so far, I would lost 
the way doing a challenge.
Then when I kind of gave up on being public about it, I started to go back to my 
old habits and I got some of it back. So right now I'm. Doing on tick-tock I'm 
doing this weight loss challenge again and I'm sharing what exercises I'm doing, 
what I meeting everyday, just to, again, hold myself accountable.
And what I'm trying is to, which is really tough. This is one part of my love 
with my life, which is tough for me is to not only lose the weight because 
that's relatively. it's just the map. If you have ambition, you can get it done. 
You just said, okay, for the next three months, I want eat and healthy. I will 
do these exercises.
And it's that the most challenging part is afterwards, like keeping the weight 
off and keeping the habits. So that's where I'm a. Kind of going now is to build 
a healthy lifestyle, which can continue after I lose the weight. So I want to 
keep it off for good. And it's still a challenge for me. It's been going on for 
a couple of years now.
But yeah. Yeah, I think a little learning and 
[00:07:55] 

**Michaela:**    yeah, I think having a healthy lifestyle is a challenge for, for 
many, many, many people. Right. Be it sleeping enough, eating healthy, you know, 
don't not gaining weight. I think also sport, like sport is something. I have a 
lot of friends that don't do any sport and I'm like always, I'm always amazed.
I also have two. Struggled quite a bit to make enough place and space in my life 
to do sport, but I always do some kind. I mean, there are always like weeks you 
know, where I didn't do it or sickness, for example, I was very sick at that 
time. I didn't do sport for a really long time or what I wouldn't consider sport 
that the, you know, the doctor would consider it even sport like walking and 
things like this.
But in general, I try really to make sure. You know, I also needed, it's also 
for my health, for example, for mental health. I always feel much better if I, 
if I do, if I do sport, but yeah, it's, there are people that don't do any sport 
and I'm always amazed. Like how, how are you doing it? Like, I really feel 
completely.
And ease and very unhappy. So yeah, maybe everybody is different. Right. But I 
think a lot of, yeah, 
[00:09:06]

**Florin:**  yeah. He's like, so we are different and some people can just have 
a great body and all of that without doing any exercises. With eating like junk 
food and all that. For me, you can quickly see that.
So if I don't take care of myself for a couple of weeks and I start eating junk 
food and stuff, it just, you can clearly say not only that my mood is going 
down, I don't have energy. And part of my reason why I'm doing I'm working out 
and all that is because of that energy, I need a. What I'm doing now as a 
content creator, making videos, live streams and all of that, I need energy and 
I need a clear mind to be able to do that.
And for that, I need to take care of my health. I need to go to sleep early. I 
need to eat healthy exercise and follow the. I mean, I guess everyone knows what 
are the good habits to do in this area. It's just sometimes we, we mess up and 
it's okay. So if we mess up once it's okay. It's not the end of the world.
It's just, the problem is when we do it through Peter Lee for weeks, that's one, 
that's when sort of say that our lives. Yeah. 
[00:10:24] 

**Michaela:**    Yeah. I think can even, you know, mess up for several years and 
still start today and say, well, today's a different day. Right. So yeah, 
exactly. Yeah. I have two little kids and I have to say it's so much more 
challenging to do all those nice things with little kids, because like, for 
example, sleep.
I mean, you can, it actually messes you up. If you have like this goal of having 
a healthy sleep habits and you have like a newborn, I mean, it's just two 
competing goals that are not, you know, you can't, you can't do them at the same 
time. And I think it took. It took almost three years that, you know, each of my 
kids, you know, we're able to slip through.
And so until that time, there is no healthy sleep you know, balance, for 
example, for yourself and with the sleep thing, you know, a lot of other things 
deteriorate because you don't sleep, you don't eat healthy because you're like 
just not, you know, really awake and not clearly thinking and so on. Right.
So that's, I think, and the same for sickness or other things, right. Just 
struggles in your life. And I think that's okay. Yeah. Whenever you wake up and 
you can try again and maybe you fail and you know, don't give up. I think this 
is probably the most. 
[00:11:32]

**Florin:**  Yeah. Yeah. This is something I like about what I'm doing now is 
that I'm okay with failing for me every day is a new day to do things.
If I mess up, for example, last week for a couple of days, I felt unproductive 
and that and that for me was okay. I accepted that, that it was okay for me to 
be unproductive because now it's a new week. It's a new day and I can pick up 
things which were not done last week. So it's okay to always like, give yourself 
this.
Boost of all right. I messed up, but it's okay. I can start over and I can do it 
right to this time. 
[00:12:19] 

**Michaela:**    Yeah. And so content creation, this is really the big thing now 
in your life, right. It's also where you build your business around and how did 
that come about and how do you, how does the monitorization work?
Can you live from it or, you know, how long did it take you to live from it? I 
think content creation. A dream of, from many people. And then the question is, 
you know, is it really working out or is it not working out? Do you think that 
you can sustainably do that for a long time? 
[00:12:50]

**Florin:**  Yeah, so I expected as a content creator on my blog writing 
articles.
This was in 2019, I think in February or March, I posted my, I restarted 
blogging because I had like seven articles. But they at least started logging 
in. I did it sort of consistently three blog posts, two or three blog posts per 
week. I had a job back then. And it just said, okay, after my day job, I'll just 
write something because it felt like something fun to do.
And they always wanted to get down this path of blogging and creating content. 
So I started blogging and at the same time I picked up a Twitter and I started 
sharing on Twitter. I started to be active on Twitter, really. I think I spent 
hours and hours per day on Twitter, interacting with people, with people, 
replying to them and all that.
And it took like six months. Well, the, the plan was actually to leave my job. 
Next year. So in 2020 January, that was the plan they need for plan. So I'll 
just try these for 10 months and see how it works. And then if it's all good, 
I'll just quit my job and do this full time. But then on June in 2019, so six 
months prior to my actual deadline, I was like, I told my wife, you know what I 
just, I want to do this now.
I mean, we had some money saved up from the job. And I was like, you know, 
let's, let's do it earlier. I mean, if it failed, I failed in six months, I'll 
get the new job and it should be okay. We use the savings and it was an 
interesting journey. I can say that it was tough because my focus wasn't. 
Monetization.
So just imagine, like in the first month I gave up my job, I made 150 bucks. So 
yeah, it went down for several K two to 150 bucks. But for me, that was okay 
because I never. I didn't chase money in the first year or so of concentration. 
Right. I liked what I was doing. I wanted to grow my reach to grow my audience, 
to get in front of multiple people.
And I knew that it will pay off one day. And they did that for, so basically I 
was blogging for six months or so. And then in November, that year I started my 
YouTube channel. And in 2020, my main goal for the year was to get 100,000 
subscribers in a year. And they started working really, really hard on that, I 
think in six months or so I published over 200 videos and livestreams on my 
channel.
Yeah. I was in the crazy, crazy mode where I was putting out content like crazy. 
Of course it wasn't like. Highest quality and all that. But for me it was a 
great practice. I, I know people say quality over quantity, but for me it was 
quantity brings quality. So I was pushing out a lot of content and see what 
works and then doubled down on that and made it better and better.
And I got monetized in February 18th or March. No, it was in March. 2030. I was 
monetized. Quickly compared to other YouTubers. And probably because I also had 
an audience on Twitter, so that helped. And then the amount of content I was 
putting off out was was a lot. So that helped as well. But from the YouTube 
revenue side, it wasn't a lot, it was like probably $400 a month or so.
Yeah. After two months or so, I don't, I don't remember now exactly the numbers, 
but the peak on my YouTube channel. Was it September where, when I did a live 
stream, another challenge, 10 pro 10 JavaScript projects in 10 hours. I just got 
the idea that morning and it was like, okay, I'm going to go home prepared.
These inches go live for 10 hours to do 10 projects. Wow. And that turned out to 
be great. That video now has over a million views. Wow. And brought in like 
three or four K sense. But like when it comes to YouTube, the trick is that 
YouTube revenue from ads is oh, okay. It really depends from which, what, which 
part you're saying now is roughly seven, $800 per month.
So it's okay. It's probably not lots of people can live off of that, but the, 
the main source of income from YouTube is that the audience, where if you create 
a digital product, you can sell that digital product and you can also have 
sponsors. So those two combined will bring in more revenue. Yeah.
That combined with some, I think I had a couple of projects for someone I 
managed to get past to that period of low-income and now the digital products 
are making good income. Roughly 3, 4, 5 came depends on the month just from 
digital products, which is mostly passive. So there, the products are out there.
And they're just selling on their own, I guess that's your book, for example. 
Yeah, so I have my ebook and I have a course on you than me, and they're both 
both doing this. Like 
[00:18:27] 

**Michaela:**    that's not counting them for the zero to 100 K. No that's so 
exactly. 
[00:18:35]

**Florin:**  Exactly. So those projects I bead last week last year, and I'm not 
comping for challenge for, for this challenge, which has started.
Two months ago or one and a half months ago. I started from zero. So everything 
I'm monetizing in, the challenge is built during the live streams. I go live 
every day from Monday to Friday and I build something and the things I'm 
monetizing then are the things which come for the challenge. Because right now I 
also have some sponsors on my YouTube channel.
And they can't add that too. I don't feel like it will be okay to add that to 
the challenge because it kind of uses my audience before the challenge. Right. 
There's just some extra income which I have. And it's not for the challenge. The 
challenge is something else in it. 
[00:19:26] 

**Michaela:**    Yeah. And so today I went on YouTube and to your profile, and 
then I saw that now you can not only subscribe, but it seems like there's a 
membership thing on YouTube.
Now, is that something that you offer and you see that it's working already? Or 
how does that work? Yeah. 
[00:19:42]

**Florin:**  Yeah. I offered this for quite, I think over a year now. And it's. 
It worked out well at the beginning, when I started to promote that I had, I 
mean, well, I had several people who subscribed who became members, but it's.
I don't know if people can rely that maybe if you offer something valuable, it 
can work out. Well, it's sort of like a Patrion, but it's built into YouTube. So 
if you have something to offer you might get more people to become members. For 
me, it was just like, Hey, if you want to support, become a member.
So that's not like a high incentive to people. To become a member. Yeah. I still 
get one. She remembers every now and then, but it's not something you can at 
least not for me because probably I haven't laboratories date to the maximum. 
[00:20:35] 

**Michaela:**    And so what do you do members get? Do they get something else or 
is it just really that, you know, they, they get the same public videos and it's 
just like, they support you and they want to be.
[00:20:46]

**Florin:**  Yeah, so you can do like sky's the limit through that? For me right 
now is you get the special badge and you get your name collar to the live 
streams. You get some special emotes who can use. A lot, a lot of value there. 
That's why probably I don't have a lot of members, but you can do that. So you 
can have specialty videos for those members.
You can offer them a one-on-one consulting or coaching, or you can send them a 
discounts on your products and like the sky's the limit to. What you can use it 
for. I'm just yeah. I even forgot. I have that enabled. And now you also have a 
button, a YouTube. They added it recently where people can thank you.
So they click the button and they can donate you. If they liked your video, they 
can donate a, I'm not sure if anyone used that button so far on. I'm not sure if 
where I can see that. So, and people also can donate through the livestreams. 
And I got a couple of those along the year or so I've been streaming probably 
for streaming.
I'm still debating, which is best YouTube or Twitch, because I noticed that on 
Twitch people are more likely to support creating. And like donate more become 
members and all that. It's just the communities built around, you know, 
supporting creators on YouTube is more like people come to watch polished 
videos, which are edited and all that it's nicely placed.
So they're not that popular right now with streaming. So probably that's why. 
People, at least in my niche, people are not. Likely to donate, 
[00:22:36] 

**Michaela:**    but how many people do have on your life? Coding streams onto it? 
[00:22:40]

**Florin:**  It depends on if I like, for example, last week I had a special 
livestream where I announced it two days prior to the event and I had over a 
hundred people joining me, but in the day day by day-by-day stream, I gets 30, 
40.
Tomorrow or less that 
[00:22:59] 

**Michaela:**    are, that are following you and your 
[00:23:02]

**Florin:**  staff. Yeah, but I mean maybe some of them leave and others join, 
but like an average of 30, 40 people tuning date. I mean, that's the number I 
see of viewers at the moment, but who knows how many people show tonight? 
[00:23:20] 

**Michaela:**    And so you, do you use restream Dan too, or something like that, 
the platform stream your Stritch video also on YouTube and the other way around 
or?
[00:23:28]

**Florin:**  No. So right now I'm only streaming on YouTube. So I'm using just 
OBS to stream directly to YouTube last year I streamed. So I started streaming 
on YouTube last year, then I moved to Twitch and now I'm back on YouTube because 
I just felt like I have a big audience here. And I don't know. I was thinking 
that I'll get more viewers over time.
I still don't know. I might have to test multiple times to see all right, which 
is best Twitch or a year to maybe just keep Twitch for streaming and a YouTube 
for videos. But I found myself that that was too lazy to just take the videos 
from Twitch and upload them again on YouTube. So I I'm just dreaming now 
because.
Easier for an hour. The goal is not necessarily to have the streams go out to 
thousands and thousands of people because I only see them after a day or so. 
They're not very polished. So the goal is to have a place where those who are 
interested to follow. Day by day didn't know that, okay. Flooring is life this 
hour everyday.
Let me check what is day. And I'm also doing recap videos every week. Now I 
messed up a couple of weeks, but the goal of the recap videos is shorter videos, 
which kind of describe what I did in the past week. And those should like push 
out the challenge idea to more people and get more people.
To eventually join me. 
[00:24:56] 

**Michaela:**    Yeah. So I have been streaming on Twitch for, I was 2019 a long 
time ago. I actually almost said, no, it wasn't. 2010 days, sorry, 2020 last 
year for a month. And also for like my challenge of building, you know, building 
a tool within 30 days. And I also went live every day was very, very nice.
I was a little bit exhausted to be honest, after 30 days with like, oh my God. 
And it was fun, but I also feel like it's really hard to do something meaningful 
in an hour. Without really preparing for it. Right. So this was also always like 
great, just jumping in and doing it on the spot. And, and then even talking with 
people, like if people are coming you're a little bit chit-chatting and then 
really getting something done, I feel it's very, very challenging is it's 
something that you felt you grew into and you just got some more, you know, some 
muscle memory to do it better.
Or do you prepare before the stream or how, how do you. 
[00:25:58]

**Florin:**  Yeah. So I have to agree, like it's very exhausting. For me, I 
just, I kind of noticed that after two hours of going live, building, 
researching, brainstorming, chatting with the people from the chat for two 
hours, I'm just dead. Like it just can't function anymore.
I need an app very bad. It's just, that's how it is. I mean, I can think on my 
head hurts from after two hours, because I think. Too much going on because I'm 
also coding and thinking at the same time, because it's not something I know by 
heart. So I have to research it. I have to think about the things I'm doing.
And at the same time, people from the chat are talking with me. I have to 
interact with them. So it it's, it's tiring. But I liked the, I liked the fact 
that I do this every, every day and the, it just. To be honest, some of some 
days, this is the highlight of the productive part of the day for me. So if I 
didn't have this, I wouldn't do anything that they, so for me, it's.
Motivating to keep doing something, even if it's just for 30 minutes or an hour, 
it's doing something towards the goal of what are a cake. And like the money 
aspect is nice. It's kind of intriguing for people to join and see, let's see 
how much money flooring made. But for me, the real goal is not necessarily the 
100 K in revenue.
I could make that it don't have to make it public. I almost did that in a year, 
so it's not the, I it's it's possible, but for me, it's just who I have to 
become, what skills they have to learn and develop and what knowledge I need to 
learn along the way to be able to do this. And I also do it publicly.
So it's, it's more about my personal growth than it is the money aspect. That's 
what motivates me. So the money goal is nice. We could public people like to 
chase those things. But yeah, it's more about, because I'm also going out my 
comfort zone because I'm building projects to monetize them. So I need to maybe 
learn new skills of how to develop a proper database and how to get that 
education and how to design well and market and all that.
So there are new skills I have to learn along the way. And that's, that's 
motivating for me and hopefully inspiring for others to get out of your comfort 
zone and money is just a return of the value you bring and grow to have. So it's 
just a matter of time afterwards. 
[00:28:35] 

**Michaela:**    So it seems like you never suffer from analysis paralysis, right.
Where you're like, oh, what should I do? Oh, this or that? Or they say that, how 
do you do, do you just do all of that? Or do you feel that 
[00:28:47]

**Florin:**  something. I feel that probably all the time is just the chat 
helps. So whenever I don't know what to do, usually what I try to do is to set 
the side tasks for tomorrow.
So whenever I'm live and I have inspiration of how to develop the project to 
bring it to the next level, I just write down a series of tasks. So then 
tomorrow, when I'm not that inspired of knowing what to do. I just have the 
tasks and another thing which really helps is the chat. So I have a couple of 
people who are joining every day and just having people to bounce off ideas and 
they give you feedback and their critique, your work is it's a great way to have 
something to do.
But I, yeah, sorry, 
[00:29:38] 

**Michaela:**    man. Do you know how, how old. Audience is, or the background or 
the new developers or the senior people are they've maybe indie hackers as well, 
or, 
[00:29:54]

**Florin:**  yeah, probably those who follow me along everyday are indie hackers 
or at least want to be in the hackers. The reason why, like I have 115,000 
subscribers, but.
Dan's joined the live streams and there isn't why is that? Because most people 
who subscribe to my channel, they subscribed for my tutorial. So like probably 
they want to learn to code, but what I'm doing now in this challenge, basically 
it's not necessarily beginner friendly, although I kind of try to make it 
beginner, flan friendly, where we build a project from scratch, but there are.
Some things which go out of that comfort zone is some things which are more of a 
business related thinking. And not a lot of people are interested in it right 
now. You know? So most people who follow me day by day they are interested in 
this like building projects, monetizing them and work for themselves kind of.
Entrepreneurial stuff. 
[00:30:57] 

**Michaela:**    So you have actually two, two sort of niches. One is the indie 
hacker niche where you have, you're building a following and then you have that 
mixed in with the, I want to be a developer niche. Right? So teaching niche, do 
you want to have them separated more? Do you feel like. You started off it, for 
example, teaching development.
And now you want to be more in the D you know, indie hacker space, or is that 
both that represents you? How do you think about that? 
[00:31:27]

**Florin:**  So throughout my journey, as a content creator, I mostly shared 
what I was doing. So I started off as a blog. Right. I was posting articles. 
Then I moved on to YouTube creating YouTube tutorials, and now I'm moving on to 
being an indie hacker.
So I'm kind of doing my own journey and. People who follow some people follow me 
for me. But then I have separate audiences for those separate stages. As I said, 
most of the people I most of the subscribers I gathered along the past year or 
so were those who are interested in learning how to code, but now as I'm 
approaching like a new direction, some of them will be interested in this too.
But I'm also now targeting another audience for me most, most about my own 
growth. And I know that if I learn stuff and share stuff, people who also want 
to do the same. The same things they will follow along. I know that with this 
new indie hacker kind of journey, I'm not targeting my older or my old audience.
But that, that's fine because it's, it's a progress in my own life. I'm just, I 
want to be I feel like I would be starting. In a place if I just don't grow, you 
know, and I will continue to address that audience as well with tutorials, but 
my life goes on and I learn your stuff and I, it. Move on, on a, on a new, 
because at the same time, there are so many YouTube stars out there doing 
tutorials for beginners and much less of those who just use the skills you're 
learning.
And building stuff, monetizing them, be your own boss. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of 
thing. I think that 
[00:33:23] 


**Michaela:**    that thinking and those fears around those thinking are very, 
very similar to those fears that you have. Oh, I studied computer science and 
now I want to be a writer. Oh my God. You know, my life will end. I'm even 
allowed to do that.
Right. So these growing aspects, I think of people and, you know, whatever you 
set out to do, and then you grow and you realize actually something else. It's 
happening in my life. I think this is very important that we acknowledge that 
and that it's really normal and it's okay. Right. You, I don't know, you studied 
history and now you want to be a developer, go do it.
Right. And now you did those videos and you want to be, you know, want to do 
other videos that are following along your life. I think that's a super 
important and we shouldn't be afraid. I think it will work out wonderful. You're 
very charismatic. So I, I was really happy that you have been on my podcast 
today and to talk with me about all of those things, content creation, 
monitorization, building an audience, and I will definitely follow you.
I will link everything down in the show notes and yeah, with those words, thank 
you so much, Lauren, for being on. 
[00:34:31]


**Florin:**  Thank you very much for having me was very nice step. Yeah. Thank 
you, 
[00:34:35] 

**Michaela:**    flooring. Bye-bye 
[00:34:36]
**Florin:** thanks. 
[00:34:38] 

**Michaela:**    I hope you enjoyed another episode of the sup engineering 
unlocked podcast. Don't forget to subscribe and I'd talk to you again in two 
weeks.
Bye.
