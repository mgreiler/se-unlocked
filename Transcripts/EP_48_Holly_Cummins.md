# Episode 48 with Holly Cummins

[00:00:00]  
**Michaela:**  Hello and welcome to the software engineering unlocked podcast. 
I’m your host, Dr. Mckayla and today I have the pleasure to talk to Dr. Holly 
Cummins. This episode is sponsored by IBM. IBM not only produces and sells 
hardware, middleware and software, but also offers hosting and consulting services. 
The part that is the most interesting to me, is that IBM is also an active research 
organization, and an enabler for innovation and transformation. One interesting 
business area is called the IBM garage -  which focuses on accelerating digital 
transformation, by helping people generate innovative ideas while it also equips 
them with the practices, technologies and expertise needed to rapidly turn those 
ideas into business value. 

Dr. Cummins was the development practice lead for IBM Garage for Cloud, before 
becoming an innovation leader in IBM’s corporate strategy team. She drives innovation 
for companies in various industries, such as banking, catering, retail or even nonprofit 
organization. She is also a Java Champion, a JavaOne Rockstar, a published author and 
a regular and vivid speaker. 
So what should I say? I'm super thrilled to have Dr. Holly Collins here with me 
today. Holly, welcome to the show. 
[00:00:56]
**Holly:** Thank you so much. It's yeah, I'm really looking forward to our chat. 
[00:01:00]  
**Michaela:**  Yeah, me too. I mean, my introduction was really, really long 
because yeah. You have so many accomplishments. It's really cool to talk with 
you.
So how does that work? Driving innovations for organizations? Can even one 
person drive an innovation for a whole organization? Or do you need like, that 
everybody is on board. How do you. 
[00:01:21]
**Holly:** I think one person can make a whole organization innovate, but one 
person can help create an environment where innovation flourishes.
I think we've certainly all seen the opposite as well. One person, if they do it 
wrong, can really best innovation across the whole organization. And I think. 
With innovation. It's about making this sorts of environments where ideas can 
grow and where there's the second, the logical safety for people to express 
ideas, but then also the organizational tolerance for risk too, to be able to 
invest in those ideas.
But then also I think you need some methodology or, or some rigor to try and. 
Manage your innovations, because I think a lot of us have as well have seen 
innovation labs where there's all these amazing ideas and then none of them 
actually make it out the door of the innovation lab. And that's fun for 
everybody, but it's not really moving things forward.
And really what you need is innovation that matters. 
[00:02:29]  
**Michaela:**  Yeah. . I'm currently working on a research project where we look 
at cultures, especially for development teams. How do they have their cultures? 
What makes them happy?
What makes them productive? What makes them innovative and psychological safety 
and, you know, being able to speak your mind. This is also important. And I 
conducted a couple of interviews. I also have worked in different organizations 
and it's just really tricky, right? I mean, it's really tricky to be in a work 
environment and being able to voice your opinion.
And some people get really lucky, but a lot of people really struggle with that, 
I think. And I don't know if it's, if it's bigger organization, I can't, can't 
even say like a bigger organization. It's more tricky than in, in smaller. I've 
been in startups. So you think, well, innovation should really flourish down.
There were like brilliant people on the team, but they're are also. They take 
all the space, right. They're very dominant people. So then all the others 
conferee so much, then there are like larger organization where you can strive. 
Is there some recipe that you can recommend for people to, you know, follow to 
get more psychological safety or do you know, be, be more self-aware if others 
even can speak their mind or, you know, like, how does that work?
[00:03:40]
**Holly:** Yeah, that, that that's yeah. Super interesting about the startups. I 
I sometimes feel at a disadvantage talking about culture cause I've worked for 
IBM, my whole career. And IBM clearly is not a startup. It's about as opposite a 
startup as, as you can get in terms of its history. But one of the things that 
I.
Like to talk about, which I think is probably quite related to your, to your 
research is the importance of fun in the workplace. And I deliberately talk 
about fun because it's a little bit provocative because we all have this sort of 
instinctive reaction that says work is a place for work. It's not a place to 
have fun.
And so then. I think by sort of choosing something that seems counter-intuitive 
and then peeling away the layers to talk about why actually that fun environment 
is really closely correlated to a productive work environment. And I think as 
well, it's, it's quite closely correlated to psychological safety.
And I think, you know, the psychological safety manual, certainly doesn't say 
let's have achieved psychological safety by, you know, installing. Ping-pong or, 
you know, that kind of thing, but, and it's, you know, and I think what I mean 
by fun as well, it's not those sort of that superficial layer of fun. It's that, 
that deeper thing where you feel the connection to your colleagues and you feel 
the work gives you joy.
[00:04:55]  
**Michaela:**  Yeah. I also saw that coming up in my own research, but also 
related research, right. That satisfaction, happiness and productivity. They are 
really concepts that are very intermingled. ? So engineers also having fun if 
they are feeling productive and productivity also means connectiveness. ? So a 
lot of developers that are interviewed, they talk about supportiveness and how 
they have to know that there is another person that I can.
Call or no call before we could walk up to them, but now we call them and they 
are there and they're helping us. If you're stuck, we don't see the siloed. 
Right. There's a friendship coming up as a concept. Right. People want 
friendship in their workplace. Yeah. I can totally relate to that. I felt really 
lonely last year working as a solopreneur.
And so that's also why I stepped a little bit away and was taking on more 
customer work again, because now I'm in teams and I'm feeling, you know, I'm 
talking to people more and this is really, I mean, it's also joy and yeah, so I 
can totally relate to that. How, how do you engage with organizations? So you 
are at IBM, but you got into different other organizations or is that all 
internally where you have like little labs that you, you know, that you try to 
get to flourish?
[00:06:09]
**Holly:** So my role at the moment it's somewhat internal and somewhat 
external. We're always working with clients, but sometimes I'm working with an 
IBM team who is working with a client, but in, in the garage we were, we were 
very outward facing client facing. And, and I think there's, there's lots of 
different answers for how do you engage with an organization?
How do you change an organization? Right. The, the answer that we chose in the 
garage is really sort of support at the top and then making the change bottom 
up. So we would try and get buy-in from the senior stakeholder. And the 
organization wanted to try working in a new way that it wanted to try bringing 
some of these, the psychological safety in the innovation.
But then also some of the other things that we talk about a lot, like, I mean, 
agility is an overused word, but that, you know, that ability to respond to 
change that, that tolerance for risk. But I think sometimes know. If if we try 
and make that change only at the top level, then it just ends up being as a lot 
of words on slides and so in.
And, and there's a lot of resistance to these ideas as well because people work 
in the way they work for a good reason. It's not like everybody's sort of set 
out and said, I know we're going to make our organizational cut culture so that 
it, you know, crushes the spirit and destroys productivity. You know, the 
intention was always to, you know, to try and achieve something good.
It's just that the side effects. Yeah. We're not good. So then what we do is we 
work with a particular team on a particular project, and we say, we're going to, 
we're going to do this particular thing and we're gonna get a result and we're 
going to do it in this new way. And you can see that while we work in this way.
Actually good things are happening, not bad things. And bringing in dev ops, for 
example, hasn't increased the, the odds of something bad happening. Look, we can 
show you it's reduced the odds of something bad happening, and look, it's 
actually made the process more rigorous, even though the process is also more 
seamless.
And so if we can do it on this one project, that's maybe not super business 
critical, let's try and now expand it to the next project that maybe is a bit 
more business critical. That, that ripple I would affect because I mean, I think 
success is the best evidence. And so when you can do something and show the 
results, then that makes people much more keen to try it for themselves.
[00:08:32]  
**Michaela:**  Yeah. So you are coming in and then you're working with one team. 
And is it only you, or is it you and the team that's working with that other 
team with that project? How does that work? 
[00:08:41]
**Holly:** Usually we'd have a team. And I think the, sort of the, at that 
teamwork aspect is, is so important.
I think going back a bit to what you were saying about the lockdown that even 
the most introverted developer, I think, you know, we, we get something. Team 
and the, the effects are much better as well. So we try and have really diverse 
teams in terms of the skills and the disciplines of the people. So normally what 
we would have is we'd have a handful of developers.
We'd have maybe some, some architecture support. But then we'd also have 
designers who are really making sure that we're focusing on. The humans using 
the technology rather than just look, it's a thing and it's shiny and I can 
install it and I can write code on it. And so I'm happy, you know, trying to 
sort of reel it back, but I'm glad you're having fun Holly, but how are we 
making life better for someone else?
And, you know, what's good. You know, cause success for any software project. 
It's not just, I did code success is something is better somewhere either at a 
business level or, you know, at a user level or that kind of thing. So on, on 
our side, we try and have this really diverse team, but then we also want to 
make sure that we're co-creating with the client.
So our ideal is that they're bringing their developers along. They're bringing 
their architects along. They're bringing their designers along as well. And then 
they're bringing a product owner because they're the one who owns the vision for 
what we're trying to do. And then that means that as well as making the thing 
we're doing a skills transfer.
And so I when I was first working in the garage, one of our, the the IBM sellers 
who we were working with got a bit grumpy because the, the sort of model that 
they had done was that we would do a thing and then they would sell training for 
the thing. And because we were. Co-creating that training just sort of happened 
on, on the job and it didn't slow anything down.
So we would be pair programming and that knowledge transfer would happen. And it 
would happen in both ways as well. So we, we know things about the carriage 
method that we can share. We know things about test-driven development dev ops, 
but then, you know, they're going to know things. Or organizational context to 
say, ah, yes.
When you want to do this, you need to tell, talk to Bob on the second floor. And 
so having the person who knows that pairing with you means that you don't sort 
of have to go through this elaborate process of I'm stuck. Who do I talk to you? 
And then, you know, try and figure it out. And they know things about their, 
their business domain as well.
And you know, the sort of the, some of these problems are really quite specific 
and niche. And, you know, you couldn't have just a general consultant go in and 
solve it without doing that. Co-creation. Yeah. 
[00:11:24]  
**Michaela:**  And how long are those engagements normally until there is some 
transformation and some knowledge transfer, how long does it take 
[00:11:31]
**Holly:** for the license?
I don't think the sweet spot is about six weeks, so that's, that's long enough 
to do something that's really meaningful to get an MVP, but it's short enough. 
That an organization will feel okay with the risk. Cause, you know, if we, if we 
sort of say, and, and, and as well, you want to make sure that at the end of it, 
those results are going out and are really visible.
So having that short cycle and then say, okay, and if we've done it once and you 
like it now, let's do it again because. You saw that result and it wasn't this 
sort of really protracted process where it took 12 months to see any change. 
Yeah. 
[00:12:10]  
**Michaela:**  So you are mentioning already a couple of development practices, 
like Def ops test driven development, and you have, I mean, the development 
practice lead for IBM garage.
So. Do you think, what are some of the development practices that you recommend 
that really everybody should do? Is it like peer programming? You also mentioned 
that or code reviews. What about testing? Do you think this is crucial? Do they 
have to do it? Can we just do it a little bit? Or can we just skip some of those 
things?
[00:12:40]
**Holly:** Yeah. We sometimes have conversations about testing because. The 
there's a trade-off I think between doing something quickly and failing fast and 
getting that rapid feedback and not over-engineering while you're doing that and 
the enormous benefits of testing. So sometimes if we're doing something that we 
know is going to be throw away, and I think there's a lot of value in doing 
something that you know, is going to be thrown away.
That is that, you know, sort of lean startup , methodology, maybe testing 
doesn't make sense. But I think in general, The, the benefits of testing are so 
great in terms of the quality of the code, but also automated testing is 
absolutely necessary to support dev ops and dev ops is really. Necessary now in 
order to support any kind of automation and efficiency and any, you know, that, 
that ability to do those repeated deployments and the ability to respond, to 
change and to manage risk.
Sometimes, you know, you sort of hear these stories of something that goes wrong 
and then an organization doesn't have any way to make a change to fix the 
problem, except either to go through. Lengthy process or to completely short 
circuit and bypass the process and, you know, have someone secure shell into the 
effective machine.
And then they change the things by hand, which is obviously not going to be 
particularly robust in terms of the repeatability or the safety or anything. So 
you sort of get this chain where you. Do dev ops, because I know it gives so 
much better results in order to do DevOps. I need to have automated testing.
If I'm going to do automated testing, I want to do it with test driven 
development, because that gives so much better quality for the tests and it. 
ensures the testability of the code and as well, I think one of the biggest 
benefits of test driven development is really to refine our understanding of the 
problem as well.
 Some people call it tested and design rather than test driven development 
because of that effect that when I sit down, I think we'll see, what am I really 
trying to do? How will I really know what I'm successful? Let me write a test 
for that. And usually what we look for with a test is something that we would 
have been looking for manually.
Anyway, you know, I go to a web page and I see this, or it prints this. It's 
always, you know, we're always looking for some evidence. We just try and encode 
that, looking for the evidence in, code, which is efficient. Usually. 
[00:15:09]  
**Michaela:**  Yeah. So test driven development often is I see it a little bit 
synonym to also unit tests instead of integration tests.
But now you also mentioned something like a UI test, for example. So do you 
have, like, do you make some distinction here and do you think one is better 
than the other? Do you see that there's a shift nowadays in industry? I see a 
shift and a little bit that, what is your perspective on that? 
[00:15:33]
**Holly:** Yeah. I mean, I like to do test driven development at, at all levels.
So I like to do test driven development for my integration tests. I like to do 
test driven development for my unit tests. I think sometimes you do get a little 
bit tangled where you can't have, you know, you sort of, you, you do your, you 
write your unit test and then it passes. And then in doing that, you've done 
enough that actually your integration tests is already passing.
So then you're. Catching up with your integration test a bit, but sometimes we 
do it the other way and we say, okay, I'm going to start with my integration 
tests. I'm going to get those integration test passing. And then I'm going to 
fill in a bit with the unit tests. But I think like, I don't think it's 
something that is just for one level.
I think if it's an outcome that you care about and that you don't want to 
regress, then there should be an automated test on it. I mean, I, I. I'm a huge 
fan of contract tests as sort of an intermediate layer between the integration 
tests and the unit tests. Cause I think sometimes with unit tests, well, 
integration tests are really expensive to run in any kind of complex 
environment, especially once you've got 60 microservices.
Good luck running the integration tests in any kind of regular way. But then 
with the unit tests, I think you can sometimes get the sort of abdication of 
responsibility where everybody owns their microservice and they run their unit 
tests and everything works great. And the system as a whole doesn't work.
And so somebody has to care about that at some point, but then you sort of end 
up playing this sort of. Sort of pass the parcel of responsibility, where 
everybody goes more, my services working as designed. And so then an on all the 
problems happened at the seams. 
[00:17:13]  
**Michaela:**  Yeah. 
, my PhD thesis was about playing in testing our plugging systems and how you 
test them. It was more or less also services, service oriented architectures at 
that point. Right. And it was pretty new. People were just jumping on that vegan 
and so on. And I said, well, you know, you were going to get a little bit into 
travel if you're, if it stayed the same with how we are doing testing and 
nowadays but you're also an expert for cloud computing.
Would you say that in the cloud world, somehow testing or in general engineering 
practices change, is there, do we have an impact we should we or can be 
developed in a different way, test, deploy everything. Why is said the same? 
[00:17:54]
**Holly:** Yeah, I think it has to be different in order to take advantage of 
the cloud.
So one of the things that you're almost certainly going to want to be doing on 
the cloud is, is that DevOps it's that more rapid deployment. And then if you. 
Deploying rapidly. And you don't actually know if your code works, then either 
you're going to have an enormous issue in production, or actually you're not 
going to be deploying rapidly, you know?
So we still sometimes see these cycles where something is getting deployed to 
the cloud, but then there's a three week UAT phase before anything can be 
deployed. And so then. You know, that just doesn't work. It's a waste of the 
cloudiness. It almost may as well be on-prem. So, so you sort of get this ripple 
back from, again from the dev ops, which you want to be doing to the testing to 
the TDD.
[00:18:42]  
**Michaela:**  I also think like we had, we had very strict roles back then. 
Right. So whatever, like operations. Yeah. The engineers, the software engineers 
or developers. And we had like the testers, then there was like a time. Now we 
have this dev ops for, you know, at one point for dev ops, I feel like every 
engineer was supposed to be a dev ops engineer.
And and then we had like the full stack. So you're not a front end or back end, 
your full stack, your full stack from front end to back into dev ops to 
everything. And now I feel people start to struggle with that concept again. No 
everything because there's so much to know that there's not a single person that 
can be like this end to end dev ops engineer to front end you know, genius.
You see dad, like is there, is there again do you see that there are more roles 
that are forming itself or a person is bringing more Def of engineer and then 
more of backend, more front end, you know, cloud maybe, you know, even more 
concepts that we have here. 
[00:19:43]
**Holly:** Yeah, that one's a really tough one.
And I, yeah, I sometimes sort of, and I think I sometimes talk to people who ha, 
who say exactly the same as you, that, that there are too many expectations on 
me and actually trying to do all of these things means that not only will I not 
be quite as good in all of them, actually, I'm going to be pretty inadequate in 
all of them.
And are you sure that's what you want? And so. I think there probably is, is a 
space for having those specialist roles. But I think part of the issue as well, 
sort of is there's an organizational decision about where do you, where do you 
put the boundaries? Because I think we probably still do want to be saying.
That if you are too specialized, it creates organizational friction because it 
means that you risk becoming a bottleneck or, or the opposite as well that it, 
you know, it means that you risk not being deployed because all of a sudden, 
none of the projects our organization is working on, have a need for your 
skills.
And since you only do this one thing really well. You're just going to be sat 
around and that's not great for us cause we're paying you and it's probably not 
great for you either because you're really bored. So let's try and have 
everybody at least be able to do a few things and let's have people really 
comfortable sharing their skills as well.
Cause I think that comes back a bit to the pair programming and the 
multidisciplinary teams that maybe I'm pretty sure. Pretty bad at front end, but 
I know just enough front end that if I'm collaborating with a front end 
developer, I can bring my something else. And we're still going to do a better 
job than if that front end developer was on their own.
And we're going to do a way better job than if I was trying to be a front end 
developer on my own. And so then you get these sort of complimentary skills in, 
in the pairs. 
[00:21:37]  
**Michaela:**  I think we are coming back again to the teams as well, or to the 
concept of a team. And that people are really strong as a team.
Maybe they are. And there was like, I did an interview with it, very senior 
engineer. And what he said is like, , if you want to go fast, go alone. But if 
you want to go far, go with the team or with people. Right. And so this was 
indeed in one of the interviews about productivity and happiness and so on.
And I think. I was also talking to Alex from FedEx and she was on my podcast. 
He's a testing expert. And she was also talking about these teams where you have 
like a person that has a strong expertise, but then this expertise somehow 
overlaps. Right? So you want to expand your expertise to other roles.
Let's say you are a testing expert, but then you want also to understand 
development a little bit, then you want to understand maybe dev ops a little 
bit. Right? And so you're having this. These shapes that are overlapping. And 
then in the same team, you have a person that is very similar to what you said, 
right?
They are front end expert. And so you're overlapping in your understanding each 
other quite a bit. Right. It's good. If you don't, if you're not solely 
responsible for everything and you can learn from each other, I think learning 
is also such an important concept for happiness.
Do you see that, that people want to learn?
[00:22:47]
**Holly:** Yeah. A a hundred percent, I think it's, it is one of those things 
that motivates you at work. Isn't it is, is that desire to learn and, and, you 
know, if you just do the same thing every day, it, I mean, it's, it's awful. 
Isn't it? There needs to be something coming in. And I think you're right.
That, that does come back to that teaming that if you're working in a team and 
people have different skills than you, then you're, you're automatically going 
to be learning. And one of the things that I always said about pairing in 
particular is, you know, there's sometimes we put sort of a hierarchy on pairing 
doughy and we say, okay, so we've got the senior developer pairing with the 
junior developer and they're teaching everything they know to.
It always, it always goes in both ways. So as a senior developer, if I'm pairing 
with a junior developer, often they'll know a framework I've never heard of. And 
so then they'll teach me about that and they'll know keyboard shortcuts. I've 
never heard of. So they'll teach me about that. And so it's always that, that 
two way knowledge transfer in, you know, independent of your position in the 
hierarchy or how long you've been anywhere.
Yeah. 
[00:23:50]  
**Michaela:**  So I hear you talk a lot about pair programming, so. I don't hear 
you talk about code reviews. What do you think about them? Do you do them, are 
they not that important? Do they compliment or do you don't need them, if you do 
poor programming, how do you see 
[00:24:03]
**Holly:** that? So my, my, my personal take is that one of the great advantages 
of pair programming is that it eliminates the need for code reviews.
And we sometimes talk about You know wait, isn't pair programming, more 
expensive. I've got two people doing the work of one person and, and, you know, 
there's all sorts of reasons why that's not true, but I think one of them is 
that otherwise you have, usually you will have a para-pro code review process at 
the end, otherwise, and that can be really expensive, so it can be expensive in 
terms of people's time, but then it can also be expensive in terms of the sort 
of thing.
Bottleneck and the blocker that it creates, and it can be expensive as well in 
terms of the, sort of the patterns that it encourages. Because if people know 
that when you put something in for code review, it takes three days to get it 
back and get it approved. You know, that's maybe a pathological case, but it's 
not that pathological people.
Aren't going to be putting things in every 10 minutes. You wait until you're 
finished something and then you send it over and then you get this. Spiral where 
the person who's doing the code review gets a mountain of code and they go, Ooh, 
I'm not, I'm not looking at that until I've got a bit of room in my schedule, 
which is three days later.
And then as well, when they look at it, usually. I see a couple of things 
happen. One is that because it's so much work, if there's a really fundamental 
design problem, either it's sort of too late and they can't see it, or they do 
see it, but they think, oh man, you know, they've been working on this for three 
days.
I can't go back and tell them they should have done something completely 
different or that they shouldn't even written any of this code. And so then the 
sort of the big problems don't get fixed and. But then you think, well, but I've 
got to show that I did the review. I've got to show that I've got some value in 
this process rather than just annoying them by waiting for three days.
Let me find the position of the semi-colon line 36. Let me comment on that. Then 
everybody knows I'm contributing. So you get this sort of bike shedding. And as 
you can tell, if I find the whole, the process for us one of the patterns that I 
really encouraged with the pair programming is that you rotate the pairs every 
day.
So that gives you a much deeper code review. Cause I think otherwise you only, 
you get like one person's code review, but then you sort of end up where two 
people can be wrong just as easily as one person or two. Certainly, you know, 
two people can be wrong. So then on the second day, A third person comes in and 
then there's already sort of another built-in code review where they, in order 
to be able to contribute, they get walked through what was done the day before.
And then they're able to say things like, oh, well, but why did we do this? And 
here, why don't we just try this? And it it's, you know, it's not a formal 
review. It's an interactive sort of getting them up to speed teaching 
experience, but then it means that there's this second chance to catch errors 
before.
Developed too much, but I think, I mean, I think you probably are. You're asking 
the question cause you, you probably have quite a lot of expertise on code 
reviews and you're gonna tell me all the patterns where it does work, which of 
course it can, then it can work 
[00:27:07]  
**Michaela:**  with no, no, but I definitely did the recall and realize all the 
things that you said, because this are definitely really common problems that I 
also see that teams have.
Right. So this is also one of the things by in my view, Teams come and they 
bring all really everything that you said, right? Like, and this whole chain of 
how it just doesn't work. Great. How to process doesn't work and where you, 
where you have this waiting time, where then the code reviews are too big, 
right.
Or you're done, cannot understand them. You still have to do them. What do you 
do? Right. So this, there is definitely this, this loop that you are describing. 
Totally recall, because this is, you know, this is the, the problems that all 
the people are bringing on the table when they're coming in, when I'm working 
with it.
Maybe what I see, I actually really liked code reviews because of this 
synchronicity. Right. So you can have them in a very lightweight way. I also see 
them complimentary a little bit to peer programming, but you definitely have to 
do them in a different way. Right. And I think what many organizations don't 
understand and why we are creating this loop of yeah.
Troublesome problems that we have, how we doing is that we don't understand the 
goal of why I'm doing this. Right. What do we want to get out of that? And then 
also, okay, what do I want to get out of that? And how can I shape the process 
in a way that I'm getting this out of that?
Because I really see that they have all these painful drawbacks. Definitely. But 
they also have like really wonderful benefits. So I think the most important is 
that you really understand. The pain points that you said very, very deeply, but 
then also, what can you, you know, what can you do to counteract them? How can 
you change your practice but, but I see, I see all the things that you say, and 
I'm actually a big fan of pairing as well. For me personally it's very draining 
to do it. Like I love it from time to time, right? Like it's the best where I 
feel like. You have your mentor there, or, you know, you have just this 
connection and the supportiveness with the people.
So I totally enjoy it from time to time, but not too often. How often do you do 
pairing? 
[00:29:17]
**Holly:** So what, what we used to do. In the, in the garage is, is we would do 
it pretty much all day, every day. And there was, there was a few advantages to 
that because I think one of the, sort of the hardest things of pairing is the 
logistics.
And so then going back to the PA to the code reviews, you know, there's some 
circumstances under which pairing just will not work and makes no sense because 
it's, it's so synchronous and asynchronous doesn't scale. So, you know, you need 
to have that kind of asynchronous process as well. And if you've got 
Particularly, you know, if it's something like open source where people are in 
different times zones and they're working different schedules and some of them 
are doing it in their own time, you know, something like pairing it, it, you 
know, it's almost off the table to, to begin with.
But what we found is if we tried to be. Ad talk with our pairing, which of 
course works quite well for a lot of teams. We sort of, we never ended up doing 
it because it would be well let yes, let's pair today. Yeah. We definitely want 
a pair today. Okay. So, so maybe after lunch. Oh, I can't after lunch, I've got, 
you know, I've got a thing.
Okay. Well we'll maybe, maybe at two o'clock. Oh, I can't. And then, you know, 
we, we settled that we're going to start pairing at three o'clock, but then 
something would come up and then somebody would be unavailable. So by sort of 
defaulting to pairing, we'd keep our calendars free. And it was great actually, 
because if we got invited to.
I'm afraid I can't attend this meeting. I'm pairing. So if you interrupt me, 
you're interrupting my hair as well as it was sort of, it was like this sort of 
intro we could block your time. 
[00:30:43]  
**Michaela:**  a couple of organizations that are working with and That we try 
something out and it looks really, really nice is that you're doing code reviews 
on a particular time.
And then it's done by one engineer. Right. But they're doing all the others can 
go in and now everything is via suit, right. As are our teams and whatnot. 
Right. So by that video conference, and so they're doing this cultural view, 
right? Everybody that's interested can join. Right. And those sessions really, 
really particularly work well.
I'm very surprised by that, but I really have good feedback from, from different 
organizations where you know, you have this casual thing where people know this 
is happening, right. One person really drives the review and the errors can 
watch ask questions, clarification questions, or, you know, other things maybe 
learn just have their fairness.
Have you tried something like that? Is that 
[00:31:36]
**Holly:** we've tried some similar things? Not, not exactly like that, but 
that, yeah, that seems, seems really good. So we did I mean, one pattern of 
course is the sort of the mobbing pattern where we say We don't just want to do 
it with two people. We actually particularly for knowledge sharing, you know, we 
want to do it with six people.
So let's all gather around the keyboard or let's all gather on the zoom, but as 
well, what we used to find was, again, it's that scaling that the pattern I 
described, where you rotate the pairs every day in a big code base. With a big 
team is still gonna be quite a while before you rotate round. And so then you do 
need something else.
So what we'd sometimes do is on a Friday, we'd do a show and tell session. So it 
was, it was very similar to what you described actually, but we'd sort of 
someone would say, okay, well, I've just done this particularly evil thing in 
this part of the code base. And nobody's sure. Yeah, understand what I've done 
unless I talk them through it, or I've just discovered this really 
counter-intuitive behavior in this library.
Let me show you all what it does. So you don't get called out the same way I 
did. So it was sort of partly a code review and then partly a, an education 
session, but it would just be really informal and just whoever had interesting 
code. Would show it and talk it through the rest of the team and then they'd ask 
questions and that kind of thing.
[00:32:46]  
**Michaela:**  So maybe one last thing that I would like to talk a little bit 
with you about is because you. You actually transitioned a way, right? From, 
from being this development lead at the IBM garage. And now you're an innovation 
leader in the corporate strategy team. What does that mean? And what, what's 
your role there?
What do you have to do? 
[00:33:05]
**Holly:** So our, our, my role in corporate strategy, it's really interesting. 
It's because I'm sort of in the, you know, we're sort of a headquarters role, so 
I'm sort of in the, in the heart of IBM in, in the center of IBM and I sort of 
get to see a lot of what's going on and what we're trying to do is we're trying 
to.
Really just be the, sort of like a free resource, both people and financial to 
try. And when we see something amazing that can't quite happen because there's 
some sort of blocker or there's just, you know, it just needs a little bit of 
money to, to get over a starting line that we can sort of give it that, that 
push.
And then hopefully. Make something amazing happen so often it's where if we have 
a client team and you know, the client really wants to do something and we 
really want to do something, but just somehow it just needs a little bit of 
money just to demonstrate to the people who have the large amounts of money that 
this is really worth doing.
And, and one of the things that we do as well, because I think as an industry, 
we've, we've moved a lot now, too. Every, you know, we always want to be trying 
to do things by actually trying them out rather than doing slides. So that 
that's not, it was new when the team I'm part of was started. It's not, it's not 
new anymore, but still in a larger organization, you still sometimes get things 
that fall between the cracks where it doesn't quite fit in, in anybody's 
mission.
But that means it's actually extra important. So then, because, because we're 
sort of central, we can bridge those, those internal barriers. 
[00:34:39]  
**Michaela:**  And do you still have a lot to do with engineering? Do you still 
develop software or is it more really strategic and leading that you're doing 
right now? 
[00:34:49]
**Holly:** It's a little bit of a mix, which I think going back to what you were 
talking about with the learning and the, and the variety, I think it is good.
So it means that whatever, whatever seems most necessary. We'll do that. So 
sometimes it's actually let me go in and architect this, let me, let me go in 
and out a bit of code. Let me, you know, I'm not a data scientist, but some of 
my colleagues are data scientists and they'll okay. Let me fix your model for 
you.
And then sometimes it's more strategic and more making those connections to say, 
actually, I can see that this is going on in one part of our organization and 
something complimentary is going on in another part of my, let me connect those 
two, and then we're going to get a better outcome. 
[00:35:31]  
**Michaela:**  Oh, that sounds like you're really having a lot of hats. I really 
liked that when I was at Microsoft, also driving bit innovation there and having 
all these different hats, like you're, you're driving projects, but you're also 
doing the implementation. I was mainly prototyping at that time.
But it also means that you, as you said, you have to learn a lot. Did it take it 
a little bit to get used to that role and know what you have to do? Do you have 
like mentors that help you or is it. Structure around some, formal mentorship 
program at IBM. How does that work? 
[00:36:03]
**Holly:** I think. With that kind of role where, where you have a lot of hats. 
I think it comes back to, to the team again and the sort of the resiliency and 
the team. So what we tend to do, because we're doing challenging things and we 
don't know in advanced necessarily what skills will be required is we, we do 
sort of go around in groups where there's more than one of us.
And then that means that whatever hat ends up being needed, there's someone who 
has that hat and then someone else who can sort of shadow the hat. 
[00:36:34]  
**Michaela:**  Yeah. Yeah. That sounds really a great team to be in. Maybe the 
last thing really last thing. And then I'll let you go. Or that I want to talk 
with you about is there's the same culture eats strategy for breakfast, right?
So, and what it means is that. The culture is of utmost importance. But also 
it's a very vicious cycle that, you know, how do you get your culture to apply 
and how do you get your team members to, you know, like each other or at least 
respect each other, right. Especially if you have, so sometimes people have I 
also have that in my workshops when we are, you know, when we are working on 
these problems, that code reviews create right where we have, for example, very 
strong personalities in a team with very strong opinions.
So it have problems, you know, like giving into, what did you hear? Do you have 
like do you have like some strategies for that? Do people do something to do, do 
some coaching or can you help can the team help itself? What's your experience 
with that? 
[00:37:34]
**Holly:** It's. It's tricky culture, because in some ways, some things about 
culture, you, you can change because you can, you know, sort of start with your 
small changes and then success is the best evidence.
And then you can roll it forward and you can make those little changes to 
encourage psychological safety. And you can have, if, if the leaders are bought 
in, then they can make some of those changes as well. But part of it then does 
still come down to the people in the team. And that is often the thing that is.
Most challenging to, to change, but, but even, even people I think are, are 
changeable. And I think sometimes characteristics that we assume are just this 
person actually are the context in which we put them as an organization or 
habits that they'd learned that with the right environment can be unlearned 
[00:38:27]  
**Michaela:**  or teamed up that makes maybe right or one person creates or 
reacts, but only two, right.
Person, but to really the whole team dynamics. Are you are you a fan of like 
bonding sessions and you know, we're people, what a team really can, you know, 
get to know each other, do you think that's 
[00:38:45]
**Holly:** I really like them, but I think they, they need to be done 
sensitively because they do end up sometimes not being very inclusive if we.
If, if we choose something that half the team love, and then some people are 
sort of stood there going, well, this isn't really what I wanted. So I think 
there sort of needs to be some, some pre-thought to, well, there's everybody in 
the team going to like going out to a noisy bar or. Does that actually not work.
And I've seen I've had some good conversations with people actually, when I talk 
about fun, because sometimes we get these sort of bonding sessions that get put 
into a team and we say, right, we're going to have fun. Now we're going to, you 
know, do our bonding and we're going to go out to a bar and some people are 
going to know this, this isn't fun for me at all.
But then there can be alternative. So some teams, for example, they'll play a 
board game at lunch. And so it means that people who need to rush home after 
school, you know, are after work to get kids from school or that kind of thing. 
You know, they're, they're included and people who don't drink are included and 
it's in sort of at work.
So then it feels like an extra nice treat. It doesn't feel like you're sort of 
being required as part of your job to go out and do things out of hours, which 
some people really object to. And so then, you know, and there's other things 
like, like that, or. This is a really old example because w w one of the other 
things that happened when I started talking about fun is lots of people told me 
about their workplaces and that the terrible unfun things that had happened.
And there was a team and they were sort of there were a support organization, so 
they would work quite long hours and shifts. And it was a distributed team. So 
what they would do is AF after five 30, they would all play quake or doom or 
something like that together.
And it was sort of back in the day when broadband at home was a luxury. So you 
would take advantage of your office network and they were, you know, they were, 
it was completely you know, a bonding thing. And they were told by management, 
if you're in the office after five 30, you have to be doing work, which I just 
thought was.
Incredibly short-sighted on the, on the part of the, that management to say, you 
know, your, your people are not on your time making the effort to get to know 
each other better and to work better as a team. And not only have you not, you 
know, encouraged this and, you know, put in money for cakes or something, you've 
actually told them they're not allowed to do it.
Yeah. Yeah. That's very, 
[00:41:08]  
**Michaela:**  very shortsighted. Yeah. Terrible mistake. But sometimes I really 
like for management, sometimes I really ask myself. How can you make this 
decision, but you know, different story. Okay. Well, Holly I know we are on 
time, so thank you so much. I could have, you know, like talked with you another 
hour, but thank you so much that I could pick your brain about everything, about 
all your experience and you know, your knowledge that you have.
Yeah. It was really wonderful that you have been on my show. Is there something 
that you want to share with my listeners? Did you think it's important for them 
maybe around culture, happiness, fun productivity, maybe a little thing that 
they can start doing today? 
[00:41:49]
**Holly:** I mean, I th I think, yeah, just to sort of think about those, those, 
those aspects of fun and, and think about how can I have more fun at work?
How can I bring more joy, joy, and delight at work, but also how can I make. 
Those around me are also having more, more joy into life at work because 
otherwise it becomes a bit one-sided. Yeah, I 
[00:42:09]  
**Michaela:**  think in general, after Corona, I call it now after COVID right. 
I just say after, because it's just nicer to say that I think we really have to 
come back to thinking more about others.
I think we haven't been thinking. Enough about others before, but I think, I 
don't know how it's in, in, you know, in the UK, but it, at least here, I feel 
people are more distance because of it. Right. And I really think we should 
think more about each other and you know, what brings us joy? How can we help 
others?
How can we be nice to others? Right. Yeah. And I think this can bring joy again 
to yourself, right? If you maybe should think about how can I make the day, a 
little bit better for my colleague today? Or help somebody? I think this can be 
a cycle of positivity. I dunno. Like, yeah. 
[00:43:00]
**Holly:** Yeah, absolutely. I think we realized one of the things that we 
realized with, with COVID is how, how much we need others and how it's, you 
know, it's not much fun without others.
Yeah. Yeah, 
[00:43:12]  
**Michaela:**  exactly. I think so, too. So I hope you all can come back 
together and then really be nice to each other and care for each other. Yeah. 
Okay. So Holly, thank you so much for being on my show. Have a wonderful. In 
them. Yeah. I hope I talk to you soon again. 
[00:43:29]
**Holly:** Yeah. Thank you so much. It was, it was great 
fun.
[00:43:32] 
** 
**Michaela:** ** Yeah. It was really fun.
