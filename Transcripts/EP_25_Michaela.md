# Transcript Episode 25 Michaela

**Michaela:** 

[00:00:00] Hello and welcome to this software engineering 
unlocked podcast! I'm your host, dr. McKayla. And today is a special episode. 
Yeah, the software engineering unlocked podcast turned one. And to celebrate the 
one year anniversary - and can you imagine it's already one year? - I thought I 
will tell you a little bit about myself.

[00:00:26] I will very inline with the theme of the show. I will tell you a little bit how I
came into tech, a little bit (about) my experiences with different companies, and also I 
will tell you about my favorite topic: code review. So yeah, let's see how that 
goes. 

[00:00:42] I'm a little bit nervous because it's the first "not-interview-style" podcast, so it means that I don't have another person interviewing me and asking me questions, so it will be all me talking and I hope that this goes well, I don't know. So yeah, about me. Well, should I start? Maybe really from the beginning, like I do with my guests. So how did I actually come into Tech, you know, that's quite a strange story because I went to a high school that was all about art. And while it's way back then a computer were already a thing, I'm not that old, but, uh, at my school, we didn't have laptops in our class. We didn't write on a word for example, or some word process or something.

[00:01:31] We wrote really still with pencil on paper. And especially when I graduated at the time we were already advanced. So in other school, people were using computers and programs to type, and our school was an art school, and so we were not very progressed. Uh, our teachers also thought, you know, "It's not a good thing", you know, "the writers write on paper", so even though when I graduated, I was still writing most of my stuff, really with pen and paper. And I had little to no exposure to computers. 

[00:02:09] We had a computer at home, but because it's, um, it was something expensive and it was something, you know, that. Also, my parents were maybe a little bit afraid of, we were not allowed to just go and play with the computer or try things out. So I really have to say my exposure to computers were really really, really limited. Yeah. Never ever would I have thought in this year that I will study computer science, but I'm in the last year before graduating and before starting a university, I actually attended a few lectures at the university and I attended lectures in different areas.

[00:02:46] So I was in one lecture about psychology. I was in an, um, lecture about physics and I was in the lecture about algorithms. And somehow I was really hooked. I never- I actually thought I will study math. This is what I thought that I will go on. But then when, when it wasn't this lecture and this professor talked about distributed systems and threading problems, and he also were talking about cash machines. And so I really could see the application of what very much looked like math to me and logic. But I could see really the impact that it has on the real world. And so I think I was hooked. So I got a first book about it, and, during the summer break, before starting university, I read this book, it was about really fundamentals.

[00:03:36]  What is an algorithm and what is computer science? Uh, still, I didn't touch any computers. Right? It was really theoretical knowledge about, you know, what computer science is all about. And I was really, really fascinated. I thought, "this is what I want to do". And so when I made the decision and I said, "I'm going to apply", my parents were not thrilled. They were like, "this is not for girls, and this is not for you and you're coming from an art background", which was very true, right? I was mainly painting pictures. I drew, I had paintings and things like that,architecture, but, um, I was always good at math and I decided, even though they weren't happy and actually even said, they're not going to really support me doing that, I went ahead, add then enrolled. 

(W.I.P)[00:04:29] And the enrollment was actually online and yeah, mr. Whitfield, to be honest. Yeah. I really failed to create an account. 
You know, dad. This was the current state that I was in. Right. So I got a 
little bit worried about, um, if I'm not even able to in role, because I had so 
little exposure to computers, internet, and things like that.
We didn't have internet at home. Um, How I'm gonna deal with that. But yeah, 
there was an it department, so they helped me actually enroll when I told them 
that I, they, I need some assistance with that and that I actually want to study 
computer science. They were also not super thrilled and I laughed a little bit 
about me, uh, but I managed to get the thing done with a little bit of help.
And, and then it was. It was really intense. I would say the first year, 
especially the first half year, it was really intense. Most of my classmates, my 
colleagues at university had a lot of knowledge already became, um, most of them 
actually came from high schools that had like, uh, Focused on computers.
They even knew how to program. And for me, everything was new and I didn't have 
really a computer and I didn't have so much money. So I bought really a crappy 
computer and, um, it wasn't good enough for, for example, the Java compilers 
really ran. So if I wanted to combine my hello world, the first program that I 
rode, it took several minutes, like 15 minutes.
It can you imagine? [00:06:00] So. Um, I knew I had to do something else, so I 
try to collect a little bit more money and make more money. I worked on the 
side. And so, um, within the first two, three months I was able to buy a better 
computer. And, um, it wasn't the best computer. Yeah. It was really nice. A nice 
laptop that, uh, got the job done.
Let's put it that way. And also, I have to say that in my computer science 
education, especially at the beginning, we did again, a lot things on, um, 
Paper. I mean, we wrote Java programs on paper. Um, not always, you really 
needed a computer and you were doing it at home. Right. Well then transferring 
what you learned in class, um, to the computer.
Uh, but yeah, so this is how I got started. And, um, I did a primer in 
programming that really helped a lot. It was very, very intense, but I, I 
studied a lot and this is purely a, the reality is that I really studied a lot 
and I really. You know, deep dive into that. I found it really also very, very 
fascinating.
So it wasn't, it wasn't hard for me. And by the, by the end of the first year, I 
was one of the best in class. And, um, this was very encouraging as well. So I, 
I didn't start really well. Uh, but yeah, based on learning a lot and really 
having an open mind and being so curious, I was able to, to level up. So while 
this was really how I started, maybe I rambled a little bit too long, but 
hopefully you find it interesting.
And well, I did Dan back down actually, when I did my, my, my. Bachelor. There 
were no bachelor and masters in Austria. I did my, my, uh, university in 
Austria, but this was one five year program. And so in the middle of when I 
started, they actually changed the thing to master and bachelor, but because I 
already took master classes, um, in my bachelor's, I then actually.
Uh, pursued the whole thing and did a bachelor in the master and the master. I 
did partly in [00:08:00] London, in the Westminster university, and this was 
really one of my best times. It was the first time that I went away from home. 
And, uh, somehow I got a little bit hooked. I really left being away and 
learning about new cultures.
Um, having a complete different perspective on life, uh, through those travels 
through those months abroad. And so when I finished my masters, I knew that I'm 
not going to stay. So yeah, I started actually as a lecturer in university and I 
teach the system security and complexity theory in algorithms. So something like 
that, introduction to algorithms.
So, but I knew that I wanted something else. So I looked around and I found a 
PhD program and I applied, and that was actually in the Netherlands. And I also 
have to say that when I graduated, this was 2008, it was a recession. So it 
wasn't the best job market. And maybe, um, I don't know if I would have done a 
PhD, if there would be a better job market I wanted to go into.
What I always wanted to do is industrial research. Right? So I wanted to be in 
industry and do the research side. Uh, but that, that bind, I think it was just 
not possible. There was no money and especially companies didn't hire, um, a lot 
of people into research, which somehow is not the most necessary thing.
I think that if times are, you know, difficult, um, a lot of resources go away 
from, from research. Anyway. So I went actually to the Netherlands and I did my 
PhD program there. Um, I was mainly looking at how people understand software 
system. So software comprehension, can we build models around? Large software 
systems, so that it's easier to really know what's happening here to get an 
overview.
And I was also diving into testing. So especially test systems when we are 
testing something, how do we know, how do we know what we should [00:10:00] 
test? Which integrations, for example, should we be testing and experimenting 
with things, things that help people really to understand their. Test suites, 
but in that aspect of dad was I got more and more into qualitative study.
So what I really, uh, enjoyed was doing this quantitative thing. So like you're 
looking at data, you're analyzing software repositories data that you're getting 
from. Uh, from what the, what the engineers produce, right? So you're looking at 
commits, you're looking at the source code. You're looking at, um, maybe 
interactions that engineers are having.
Right. But this in a, in a very quantitative way. Um, so you're doing a lot of 
data mining there and maybe. I have some algorithms around to extract 
intriguing, interesting patterns, and then compliment that with qualitative 
research. So instead of saying, well, we extracted, you know, let's say to get 
history and then we saw, and we have some way to detect, let's say some smells 
anti-patterns in the software.
And then we look over time, you know, did they increase or decrease? And we 
correlate that, for example, with different aspects of the, of the software 
system, like how much ownership. Does a person have, like, I did things like 
that. Right. And you can do that just with code. You can do that just with the 
artifacts that are there.
Yeah. But this is very, very limited. The things that you're seeing have to 
reflect on that and really ask the people behind. So, um, so I got more and more 
hooked into it. Combining quantitative work with qualitative work, which means 
that you're observing people that you are talking to engineers. Um, that you 
are, are doing it some surveys, for example, Serbia research.
And I really found it extremely, really powerful if you have both worlds 
together. So this was mainly what I did at my PhD. So I'm looking for example, 
how are people testing, [00:12:00] blogging software, right? Plugging systems. I 
worked a lot with the eclipse community and, uh, based on that, I. Still had 
this dream of becoming a researcher in industry.
And somehow, uh, at the conference, I came in contact with people from Microsoft 
research and I always admired them. And this was definitely where I wanted to 
be. This is, yeah, this was my dream. And. Yeah. Luckily I got the opportunity 
to do an interview and so they liked my work and they invited me and thought 
it's very similar to what they want to do.
And, uh, yeah. And then I had a full blown interview was probably my most. 
Advanced interviewed that I ever, ever had. It was, um, first it was like, I had 
to, well, first they were like this discussions during the conferences. Right. 
And then I had like a screening interview and then where we just talk about, you 
know, what I like and, you know, just, you know, get to meet each other.
And then I had like a, um, at home assignment, like homework, more or less, I 
had to think of some kind of calculated, it had to program and then send them 
over. And they looked at the code and then based on that they would schedule the 
next interview. And so then I had an interview with two people via, um, phone or 
video conference, and this was really, really stressful because on that day, My, 
uh, my internet connection was so poor and I could barely hear what they were 
talking and yeah, I was in the student housing.
So, um, the walls are really thin. And so if other people talk in my, my flag, 
right. Um, it was super loud and they were talking and they were, they were not, 
I mean, the knew that I am going to have an interview, you, but they were not 
paying any attention probably for God. And then their internet connection 
[00:14:00] was so bad.
And I barely heard when people were saying, and I was too afraid to say, Um, 
it's not working right. Or can we reschedule, like I dare to ask probably to 
repeat a couple of, but even that, I mean, if you ask seven times or could you 
please repeat, or I couldn't hear you, um, it gets really bad. Right. And so. I 
actually thought I blew the, this interview.
I was very sad on that day and it took quite a while for them to get back to me, 
to tell me, you know, if I pass or if I didn't pass. But you know, when they 
did, um, they came back and said, yeah, the interviews went bell. And, um, and 
then they, they said, well, I, you should come for an onsite interview. And at 
that time I was living in the Netherlands.
So on this meant that I have to fly to Seattle. And so I was super, super 
excited. Yeah. I was super excited. And the, yeah, I think within two weeks, um, 
they flew me over before that I really practiced some algorithms and, um, you 
know, Everything again, just to refresh my mind. I'm also a person that's very, 
very nervous during interviews.
And so sometimes I'm a little bit better because of that. Sometimes I'm worse 
because of that, because of my anxiety a little bit. But yeah. So when you flew 
me over, it was very interesting experience, uh, to be, to be in Seattle. I've 
never been there before. And then I had a whole day of interviews, like it 
started.
I can't completely recall, but I think around nine in the advent on until really 
late in the evening. And the only thing that I knew is that that's a good sign. 
So what I heard about the interviews is the longer you last write the better. So 
if let's say you have two interviews and it's, they're stopping after that, 
that's not a good sign.
I don't know. Maybe if you're having really a lot of interviews, that's also not 
a good time. I don't know. But. Well, what I can say is that I actually 
performed very [00:16:00] well during these interviews from my perspective. So I 
had, it was very, very classical interview, like white boarding exercises, all 
over traversing trees doing some design work, as well as some architectural 
work.
And I was also talking about my research was probably the easiest and most fun 
part of the whole interview. Uh, one thing that I didn't like was that the 
interview, I mean, it was, people were going with lunch with me. Right. But it's 
still an interview, right. It was still somehow in interview. And this was 
really uncomfortable for me.
I would read, I have had my break by myself, like recharging a little bit 
because I was with, you know, People that I don't know the whole day. And so 
even after, or during lunch and I'm chewing, you know, my sandwich trouble, I 
still have to talk. And like, this was, um, this was probably the part that I 
didn't didn't enjoy so much.
Uh, but I know that it was it wasn't nice and kind intention, right. That I 
don't have to go by myself or having lunch. Um, but also discussion was about 
work. So. I would still say this was interviewed during lunch with yeah, it was 
stressful. Just put it that way. Anyway, in general, it was a very positive 
interview experience.
I had worse. Interview experiences. Um, like I didn't feel like judged or I 
didn't feel like people have an immediate bias when they see me, because 
sometimes, uh, in previous interviews I had that, like they were saying, I was 
interviewing for software engineer and he was saying, Oh, you're here for the PM 
position.
I'm like, no, I'm here for the software engineering position. Oh. So, but I 
think you want to do the PM. Product manager position? No, no. I want to be a 
software engineer here and things like that. Right. Or one company. Um, I was, 
again, interviewing to be at software engineering day. They always try to put me 
into the tester area, which is fine if you want to be a tester, but I didn't.
And so, [00:18:00] um, so I expected something like this to happen, but no, it 
was really, they, I felt like they take this. Interview also very serious. And 
they, they didn't, you know, I didn't have to earn kind of level of trust. Uh, 
but there was some kind of trust, like you pass already things and we know your 
credentials.
And so, um, now we just make sure that, uh, you, you really can do what we want 
you to do something like that. Right. So it was very challenging, but I didn't 
feel like. Um, there was a negative bias against me. Well, I'm rambling. I don't 
know. Is that going well, is this first episode me telling you things are going 
well, I don't know.
Anyway, so this is how I started actually then, uh, at Microsoft. So they didn't 
tell me immediately. I think I actually can't completely recall, but I knew that 
because I, it was not only the head of this department, but also the head of the 
division that interviewed me on that day. And I heard that if. He wants to 
interview you then more or less, you know, you pass if he's happy.
So I was very confident then actually I really got an offer into, I got sort of 
my dream job then I, yeah, I'd rent off for, for many years. And it was like 
this, it was really like this. So I first moved to inland. Um, I joined 
Microsoft research in India. Okay. And then a little bit later, I joined 
actually Microsoft corporation, um, in, in Seattle, in Redmond.
And I was part of a really amazing team. Um, at that point it was called tools 
for software engineers. Now it's called one. Yes. And they were looking at 
improving, you know, the stuff, engineering practices of the 40,000 engineers 
that there are at Microsoft. And so, I mean, this was, this was the best. You 
have all, you have this responsibility to really make an impact, but also you 
[00:20:00] have like all these data available.
So we were building a platform to extract engineering data and yeah. So. I was 
really happy at that point. It was very overwhelming at the beginning to learn 
everything and to know how engineers at Microsoft tick and, you know, you have a 
lot of divisions. So culturally, um, engineering teams are also very different 
at micro.
It's, not like one. One thing. Uh, and so I had to learn a lot and also get used 
to, you know, the new country, the new continent, even right. To get settled. 
And so it was really, really beautiful and I really enjoyed it, but life didn't 
really. You know, from a professional perspective things really, really well.
And I also enjoyed Seattle. I really loved the West coast, but from a personal 
side, things didn't go so well, my husband didn't get a visa. And so we had to 
stay separated. He was actually living in at the beginning in Europe. That was 
really hard. And then he moved to Vancouver and so he was working for a software 
company there.
And so we traveled back and forth. It was four hours. Uh, if everything goes 
mousse and we did it for quite some time, but at one point, you know, after 
several years I was. While we missed our time together. Yeah. And so, even 
though I love this, this job, I took a really big risk, sad. I have to move. I 
have to move to a place where my husband can also work and where we can stay 
together.
Yeah. And, um, luckily my team was actually agreeing that I could to work 
remote. And so this is how I actually started working remote. And I have to say 
I'm a big remote fan. It was. It was really cool to work with him. And it was 
really also fitting to my personality probably. Right. So I'm very organized and 
I can, I can motivate myself very well.
And, um, so yeah, so I [00:22:00] actually moved back to Europe with my husband 
and we moved in together, which was beautiful. And that was very, very grateful 
that yeah, I could continue with my team and, um, mid my job. To be fair Europe 
and America it's quite different, right? From a, from a time perspective. And 
because my team wasn't remote first was not even remote.
Right. Uh, it was, it was a little bit challenging to, to work. I mainly worked 
there hours, right. So I came in very late. And I tried that I have a lot of 
over a lave in their working hours with the Seattle Pacific time. So, and that's 
not, not the easiest if you are in central European time zone, but without 
family, it was definitely manageable.
But at one point I wanted to have more flexibility also regarding my family 
life. So, because I actually became a mother in this time, actually, when, when, 
when max was really little, it was. Still very cool because I could take care of 
him during the day and then work in the night, but it was very, very exhausting.
And so I actually knew that something has to change. And so slowly I 
transitioned to my own business to start my own business, to start my own thing. 
So I knew that I wanted to do something very similar working with teams, helping 
them improve their software engineering practices. And so, yeah. It took me a 
little bit to figure out how I could actually bring this idea, this desire to 
live.
Right. How can I leverage all the things that I did? The knowledge that I gained 
theoretically and practically working with engineering teams and how can I do 
that in an very independent way? So this was something that was front of my mind 
for a couple of months, until a year almost. And so I slowly transitioned them, 
start to work with customers, with the companies outside of Microsoft.
And, um, the good thing is if you're working in Europe, in [00:24:00] Germany, 
it's okay. If you have like a it's, I think it's moonlighting in English. So you 
can and do that. Like, if you're, if you're transparent about it and you're 
telling your manager, then you can do something outside of your regular work 
hours.
And so this is what I. But I actually started, especially when I was on parental 
leave, there was more time to actually do something like that and transitioning 
away. And so, yeah. And so this is actually how, how I started my training 
business. So I've training and consulting business in the court review.
Space and I'm, yes, I'm giving workshops, I'm working with teams and to help 
them be productive, very efficient and effective with contributes. And this is 
exactly, you know, it's playing so much to my strengths and to the vision that I 
had that I want to do continue working with engineering teams. Right.
But now it's not one company it's really all over the world and it's not like a 
large corporation. But I'm working. I work with different other large 
corporations, but I also work with really small companies or with smaller 
companies actually with companies of all sizes. And so, uh, for my curiosity of 
how things work, it's very beneficial.
And maybe, yeah, well, I haven't talked with you about so much is white coat 
reviews, right? I actually probably am not going to talk about a lot about 
quarters in this episode. Time flies. I talked a lot about my, my journey. I 
will do say in another episode anyway, um, why caught reviews? Well, Um, at 
Microsoft, we were lucky add software engineering practices.
So we were not only looking at code reviews, but also contributors. We were 
looking at how people are testing their system, how they are building and also 
owning the code review tool, the internal culture rate or code flow. And so we 
were also looking at. Um, how are our engineers actually doing country race?
Is that beneficial for them? Right. So what we saw is that teams were spending a 
lot of time on code reviews. You were spending over six hours and this was back 
then. Now [00:26:00] they are even spending more. Right. But even back then, 
They were spending over six hours doing code review. So obviously we wanted to 
know, is that beneficial for them?
And so we were working with different teams and we could see that some teams 
are, you know, using coteries better than others. So we wanted to distill best 
practices that we can down, help other teams to adopt. Yeah, I've found this so 
fascinating when I was working at Microsoft because it's really a 
socio-technical.
Practice. Right. So there's a lot of social skills that people have to bring to 
the table, but there's also a lot of technical skills that the makeup, the good 
code reviewer. And then there is also this process perspective, like as  team, 
how are you actually doing code reviews? And there's, there's so many unknowns, 
right?
A lot of people thinking about the testing strategy, a lot of people, our 
engineers are thinking about, you know, how do you write code? They're doing a 
lot of trades meanings in that area, but, but code reviews, I think is something 
that has picked up a lot of steam. Like a lot of companies adopted that 
practice.
Uh, but there isn't a lot of. Great information out there. There isn't a lot of 
training out there teaches people how to actually do careers effectively. Yeah. 
And there are things that you should know. Um, and so this is where I saw 
actually a little bit like, eh, a hole in the market, a space that I could fill 
in.
Um, that I had a lot of knowledge. I had a lot of, um, passion also for this 
topic. And so this is actually how I came about during my code rule workshops 
and yeah. Writing my code rule book that, you know, I'm writing right now and 
what's on my bucket list as well as I want to also develop a tool in that space.
And I hope that end of this year, beginning of next year, I will really start 
with that idea. And bring that to life and experiment with that. So this brings 
me to the end of this episode. Let me know if you enjoyed it next episode. If 
it's just me talking again, will not be about my journey. [00:28:00] Uh, but I 
thought maybe, you know, Well code reviews could be one thing.
Like I'm telling you my, my perspective on how you can do code reviews more 
effectively. You can also talk about testing for example, or other engineering 
topics. So everything that actually interests me a lot, and I have a lot of 
passion for, and that I hope will bring you also some joy in some interesting 
perspectives.
So have a good day and talk to you in two weeks. Bye bye. I hope you enjoyed 
another episode after sup engineering unlocked podcast. Don't forget to 
subscribe. And I talk to you again in two. Bye.
