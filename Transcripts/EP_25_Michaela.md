(*intro music*)

[00:00:00] Hello and welcome to this Software Engineering 
Unlocked podcast! I'm your host, Dr. McKayla, and today is a special episode. 
Yeah! The software engineering unlocked podcast turned one. And to celebrate
the one year anniversary - and can you imagine it's already one year? - I 
thought I will tell you a little bit about myself.

[00:00:26] I will very inline with the theme of the show. I will tell you a 
little bit how I came into tech, a little bit (about) my experiences with 
different companies, and also I will tell you about my favorite topic: code 
review. So yeah, let's see how that goes. 

[00:00:42] I'm a little bit nervous because it's the first "not-interview-style" 
podcast? So it means that I don't have another person interviewing me and asking 
me questions, so it will be all me talking and I hope that this goes well. 
(*laugh*)I don't know. So yeah, about me. Well, where should I start? Maybe
really from the beginning - like I do with my guests. So how did I actually 
come into Tech. You know, that's quite a strange story because I went to a 
high school that was all about art. And, well, it's way back then - computer
were already a thing - I'm not that old, but at my school, we didn't have 
laptops in our class. We didn't write on Word, for example, or some word 
processor or something.

[00:01:31] We wrote, really, still with pencil on paper. And especially when I 
graduated at the time we were already advanced. So in other school, people were 
already using computers and programs to type, and our school was an art school, and so 
we were not very progressed. Our teachers also thought, you know, "It's not 
a good thing", you know, "Writers write on paper", so even though when I 
graduated, I was still writing most of my stuff, really with pen and paper. And 
I had little to no exposure to computers. 

[00:02:09] We had a computer at home, but because it's- it was something 
expensive? And it was something, you know, that...also my parents were maybe a 
little bit afraid of? We were not allowed to just go and play with the computer 
or try things out. So I really have to say my exposure to computers were really - was
really, really limited. Yeah. Never ever would I have thought in this year that 
I will study computer science. But in the last year before graduating and 
before starting university, I actually attended a few lectures at the 
university and I attended lectures in different areas.

[00:02:46] So I was in one lecture about psychology. I was in a lecture 
about physics and I was in the lecture about algorithms. And somehow I was 
really hooked. I never- I actually thought I will study math. This is what I 
thought that I will go on. But then when, when I was in this lecture and this 
professor talked about distributed systems and threading problems, and he also 
were talking about cash machines. And so I really could see the application of 
what very much looked like math to me and logic. But I could see really the 
impact that it has on the real world. And so I think I was hooked! So I got a 
first book about it, and during the summer break, before starting university, I 
read this book, it was about really fundamentals.

[00:03:36]  What is an algorithm? and What is computer science? Still, I didn't
touch any computers. (*laugh*) Right? It was really theoretical knowledge about, 
you know, what computer science is all about. And I was really, really 
fascinated. I thought, "this is what I want to do". And so when I made the 
decision and I said, "I'm going to apply", my parents were not thrilled. They 
were like, "this is not for girls, and this is not for you and you're coming 
from an art background", which was very true, right? I was mainly painting 
pictures. *laugh* I drew, I had paintings and things like that, architecture, 
but I was always good at math. And I decided even though they weren't happy and 
actually even said they're not going to really support me doing that. I went 
ahead, and then enrolled. 

[00:04:29] And the enrollment was actually online and I miserably failed to be 
honest. Yeah, I really failed to create an account. You know this was the 
current state that I was in, right? So I got a little bit worried about, um, if 
I'm not even able to enroll, because I had so little exposure to computers, and 
internet, and things like that. We didn't have internet at home. How I'm 
gonna deal with that? But yeah, there was an I.T. department, so they helped me 
actually enroll when I told them that I- they- I need some assistance with that 
and that I actually want to study computer science. They were also not super 
thrilled and I laughed a little bit about me, but I managed to get the thing 
done with a little bit of help. And then it was... It was really intense. I 
would say the first year, especially the first half year, it was really intense. 
Most of my classmates, my colleagues at university had a lot of knowledge 
already became, um, most of them actually came from high schools that had like, 
focus on computers. They even knew how to program. And for me, everything 
was new and I didn't have really a computer and I didn't have so much money, so 
I bought really a crappy computer and it wasn't good enough for- for 
example, the Java compilers rarely ran. So if I wanted to combine my 'Hello 
World', the first program that I wrote, it took several minutes - like 15 minutes 
can you can imagine? 

[00:06:00] So. I knew I had to do something else, so I tried to collect a 
little bit more money and make more money. I worked on the side. And so
within the first two, three months I was able to buy a better computer. It 
wasn't the best computer but it was really nice. A nice laptop that
got the job done. Let's put it that way. And also I have to say that in my 
computer science education, especially at the beginning, we did again, a lot 
of things on paper. I mean we wrote Java programs on paper. Not always do you 
really needed a computer and you were doing it at home, right? Well then 
transferring what you learned in class to the computer. But yeah, so 
this is how I got started. I did a primer in programming that really 
helped a lot. It was very, very intense, but I studied a lot. This is 
purely...reality is that I really studied a lot and I really, you know, 
deep dived into that. I found it really also very, very fascinating. So it 
wasn't, it wasn't hard for me. And by the end of the first year, I was 
one of the best in class. And this was very encouraging as well. So I 
didn't start really well. But yeah, based on learning a lot and really 
having an open mind and being so curious, I was able to level up. So while 
this was really how I started, maybe I rambled a little bit too long, but 
hopefully you found it interesting. And well, Then back then, actually, when I 
did my bachelor, there were no bachelor and masters in Austria. I 
did my university in Austria, but this was one five year program. And 
so in the middle of when I started, they actually changed the thing to master 
and bachelor. But because I already took master classes in my bachelor's, I 
then actually, pursued the whole thing and did a bachelor and the master. And the 
master I did partly in London, 

[00:08:00] in the Westminster University, and this was really one of my best 
times. It was the first time that I went away from home. And somehow I got 
a little bit hooked. I really loved being away and learning about new cultures. 
Having a complete different perspective on life through those travels 
through those months abroad. And so when I finished my masters, I knew that I'm 
not going to stay. I started actually as a lecturer in university and I 
teach the system security and complexity theory in algorithms. So something like 
that, Introduction to Algorithms. But I knew that I wanted something else, 
so I looked around and I found a PhD program and I applied! And that was 
actually in the Netherlands. And I also have to say that when I graduated, this 
was 2008, it was a recession. So it wasn't the best job market. And maybe I 
don't know if I would have done a PhD, if there would be a better job market. I 
wanted to go into- what I always wanted to do is industrial research, right? So 
I wanted to be in industry and do the research side. But that point I 
think it was just not possible. There was no money and especially companies 
didn't hire a lot of people into research, which somehow is not the most 
necessary thing. I think that if times are, you know, difficult, a lot of 
resources go away fom research. Anyway, so I went actually to the 
Netherlands and I did my PhD program there. I was mainly looking at how 
people understand software systems. So, software comprehension - can we build 
models around large software systems so that it's easier to really know what's 
happening here. To get an overview and I was also diving into testing. So 
especially test systems. When we are testing something, how do we know, how do we 
know what we should test? 

[00:10:00] Which integrations, for example, should we be testing. And 
experimenting with things that help people really to understand their test 
suites. But in that aspect of that, I got more and more into qualitative 
studies. So what I really enjoyed was doing this quantitative thing. So like 
you're looking at data, you're analyzing software repositories data that you're 
getting from what the engineers produce, right? So you're looking at 
commits. You're looking at the source code. You're looking at maybe 
interactions that engineers are having, right? But this in a very 
quantitative way. So you're doing a lot of data mining there and maybe 
have some algorithms around to extract interesting patterns. But then compliment 
that with qualitative research. So instead of saying, well we extracted the git
history and then we saw, and we have some way to detect, 
let's say some smells - anti-patterns in the software. And then we look over time, 
you know, did they increase or decrease? And we correlate that, for example, 
with different aspects of the software system. Like how much ownership 
does a person have. I did things like that, right? And you can do that 
just with code. You can do that just with the artifacts that are there. But this 
is very, very limited. The things that you're seeing have to reflect on that and 
really ask the people behind. So I got more and more hooked into 
combining quantitative work with qualitative work, which means that you're 
observing people that you are talking to engineers. That you are doing 
some surveys, for example, Survey Research. And I really found it extremely 
powerful if you have both worlds together. So this was mainly what I did at my 
PhD. I'm looking for example, how are people testing blogging software

[00:12:00] right? Plug-in systems. I worked a lot with the Eclipse community 
and based on that, I still had this dream of becoming a researcher in 
industry. Somehow at the conference, I came in contact with people from 
Microsoft Research and I always admired them. This was definitely where I 
wanted to be. This is, yeah, this was my dream. And yeah. Luckily I got the 
opportunity to do an interview. They liked my work and they invited me and 
thought it's very similar to what they want to do. And yeah! I had 
a full blown interview. It was probably my most advanced interview that I ever had. 
First it was like, I had to- Well first there were like this 
discussions during the conferences right? Then I had a screening 
interview where we just talk about what I like and you know...just get to meet 
each other. And then I had like at home 
assignment, like homework, more or less. I think it was some kind of 
calculator that I had to program and then send them over. They looked at the 
code then based on that they would schedule the next interview. So then 
I had an interview with two people via phone or video conference. This 
was really, really stressful because on that day, my internet connection 
was so poor and I could barely hear what they were talking. I was in 
student housing so the walls are really thin. So if other people 
talked in my flat, right? It was super loud and they were talking and 
they were, they were not- I mean they knew that I am going to have an interview
but they were not paying any attention - probably forgot. And then their 
internet connection was so bad. 

[00:14:00] And I barely heard what people were saying, and I was too afraid to 
say, "It's not working" right?  Or "Can we reschedule". I dared to ask 
probably to repeat a couple of things, but even that, I mean if you ask seven 
times or "Could you please repeat" or "I couldn't hear you". It gets really 
bad, right? So I actually thought I blew the interview. I was very 
sad on that day and it took quite a while for them to get back to me - to tell 
me, you know, if I pass or if I didn't pass. But you know, when they did,
they came back and said, yeah the interview went well. Then
they said, "You should come for an onsite interview". And at that time, I 
was living in the Netherlands. So this meant that I had to fly to Seattle. 
I was super, super excited. Yeah. I was super excited. I 
think within two weeks, they flew me over. Before that, I really practiced 
some algorithms and everything again - just to refresh my mind. 
I'm also a person that's very nervous during interviews. Sometimes 
I'm a little bit better because of that. Sometimes I'm worse because of that, 
because of my anxiety a little bit. But yeah, so they flew me over. It was a
very interesting experience to be in Seattle. I've never been there 
before. Then I had a whole day of interviews. It started - I can't 
completely recall - but I think around nine and it went on until really late in 
the evening. The only thing that I knew is that that's a good sign. So what 
I heard about interviews is the longer you last the better. So if, 
let's say, you have two interviews and they stop after that - that's 
not a good sign. I don't know. Maybe if you're having a lot of 
interviews, that's also not a good sign. I don't know. But what I can say 
is that I actually performed very well during these interviews,

[00:16:00] from my perspective. It was a very, very classical interview.
Like white boarding exercises, or traversing trees, doing some design work, 
as well as some architectural work. I was also talking about my research - it was 
probably the easiest and most fun part of the whole interview. One thing 
that I didn't like was that the interview - I mean people were going 
with lunch with me but it's still an interview, right? It was still 
somehow an interview. This was really uncomfortable for me. I would rather 
have my break by myself, like recharging a little bit because I was with, you 
know, people that I don't know the whole day. So even after, or during lunch 
and I'm chewing, you know, my sandwich (*laughs*) I still have to talk. This
was probably the part that I didn't enjoy so much. 
But I know that it was - it was a nice and kind intention, right? That I don't 
have to go by myself or having lunch. But also discussion was about work so
I would still say this was an interview during lunch. It was 
stressful. Just put it that way. Anyway, in general, it was a very positive 
interview experience. I had worse interview experiences. I didn't feel judged.
I didn't feel like people have an immediate bias when they see 
me, because sometimes in previous interviews I had that. They were 
saying- I was interviewing for software engineer and he was saying "Oh, you're 
here for the PM position?" I'm like, "No, I'm here for the software engineering 
position." "Oh. So...but I think you want to do the PM- Product Manager position." 
"No, no. I want to be a software engineer here" and things like that, right? Or 
one company I was, again, interviewing to be a software engineer.
They always try to put me into the tester area, which is fine if you want to be 
a tester, but I didn't.

[00:18:00] So I expected something like this to happen, but no, it was 
really...I felt like they take this interview also very serious. They 
didn't, you know, I didn't have to earn kind of level of trust. But 
there was some kind of trust, like you passsed already things and we know your 
credentials, and so now we just make sure that you really can do 
what we want you to do. Something like that, right? So it was very challenging, 
but I didn't feel like there was a negative bias against me. Well, I'm 
rambling. I don't know. Is that going well? (*laughs*) Is this first episode me 
telling you things are going well. I don't know. Anyway, so this is how I 
started actually then at Microsoft. They didn't tell me immediately, I 
think? I actually can't completely recall, but I knew that because I - it was 
not only the head of this department but also the head of the division that 
interviewed me on that day. I heard that if he wants to interview you then 
more or less, you know, you passsed if he's happy. So I was very confident then 
actually I really got an offer into, I got sort of my dream job that 
I'd dreamt of for many years. And it was like this, it was really like this. So 
I first moved to England. I joined Microsoft Research in the UK and then a 
little bit later, I joined actually Microsoft Corporation in Seattle -  
in Redmond. And I was part of a really amazing team. At that point it was 
called Tools for Software Engineers. Now it's called One ES. And they were 
looking at improving, you know, the software engineering practices of the 40,000 
engineers that there are at Microsoft. And so, I mean, this was the 
best. You have all, you have this responsibility to really make an impact, but 
also you 

[00:20:00] have like all these data available. So we were building a platform to 
extract engineering data, and yeah! I was really happy at that point. It 
was very overwhelming at the beginning to learn everything and to know how 
engineers at Microsoft tick and you know- you have a lot of divisions, so 
culturally engineering teams are also very different at Microsoft. It's
not like one thing. So I had to learn a lot and also get used to, 
you know, the new country, the new continent even right? To get settled. And so 
it was really, really beautiful and I really enjoyed it, but life didn't really, 
you know, from a professional perspective things went really, really well. I also 
enjoyed Seattle. I really loved the West coast, but from a personal side, things 
didn't go so well. My husband didn't get a visa. So we had to stay 
separated. He was actually living in - at the beginning - in Europe. That was really 
hard. Then he moved to Vancouver and so he was working for a software 
company there. We traveled back and forth. It was four hours? If 
everything goes smooth. We did it for quite some time, but at one point, you 
know, after several years, I was - well we missed our time together. And 
so, even though I love this job, I took a really big risk and I said "I 
have to move. I have to move to a place where my husband can also work and where 
we can stay together". Luckily my team was actually agreeing that I 
could work remote. So this is how I actually started working remote. 
I have to say I'm a big remote fan. It was really cool to work remote.
And it was really also fitting to my personality probably, right? So I'm very 
organized and I can motivate myself very well. So yeah! I 

[00:22:00] actually moved back to Europe with my husband and we moved in 
together, which was beautiful. I was very, very grateful that I 
could continue with my team and with my job. To be fair, Europe and America - 
it's quite different, right? From a time perspective. Because my 
team wasn't remote first- was not even remote, right? It was a little 
bit challenging to work. I mainly worked their hours, right. So I came in 
very late. And I tried- but I have a lot of over lave(??) with their working hours 
with the Seattle Pacific time zone. That's not the easiest if you are in 
central European time zone but without family it was definitely manageable. 
But at one point, I wanted to have more flexibility also regarding my family 
life because I actually became a mother in this time. Actually,
when Max was really little, it was still very cool because I could take care of 
him during the day and then work in the night but it was very, very exhausting. 
I actually knew that something has to change. So slowly, I 
transitioned to my own business, to start my own business, to start my own thing. 
I knew that I wanted to do something very similar working with teams, helping 
them improve their software engineering practices. It took me a 
little bit to figure out how I could actually bring this idea. This desire to 
live, right? How can I leverage all the things that I did? The knowledge that I 
gained theoretically and practically working with engineering teams. How can 
I do that in an very independent way? So this was something that was front of my 
mind for a couple of months until a year almost. I slowly transitioned 
and started to work with customers- with companies outside of Microsoft. 
The good thing is if you're working in Europe, in 

[00:24:00] Germany, it's okay if you have like- I think it's 
called 'moonlighting' in English. So you can do that. If you're
transparent about it and you're telling your manager, then you can do something 
outside of your regular work hours. This is what I actually 
started. Especially when I was on parental leave, there was more time to 
actually do something like that and transition away. So yeah!
This is actually how I started my training business. So I- training and 
consulting business in the code review space. Yeah, so I'm giving 
workshops, I'm working with teams and to help them be productive, very efficient 
and effective with code reviews. And this is exactly, you know, it's playing so 
much to my strengths and to the vision that I had that I want to do - continue 
working with engineering teams, right? But now it's not one company. It's really 
all over the world and it's not like a large corporation. But I'm working- I 
work with different other large corporations, but I also work with really small 
companies or with smaller companies. Actually with companies of all sizes. So for my curiosity of how things work, it's very beneficial. And maybe- 
yeah, well, I haven't talked with you about so much is 'why code reviews', right? 
(*laughs*) I actually probably am not going to talk about a lot about code reviews in this 
episode. Time flies. I talked a lot about my journey. I will do say in 
another episode. Anyway, why code reviews? Well, at Microsoft, we were 
looking at software engineering practices. We were not only looking at code 
reviews, but also code reviews- We were looking at how people are testing their 
system, how they are building and we were also owning the code review tool - the internal 
code review tool, Code Flow. We were also looking at how our 
engineers actually doing code review. Is that beneficial for them? Right? So 
what we saw is that teams were spending a lot of time on code reviews. We were 
spending over six hours and this was back then. Now

[00:26:00] they are even spending more, right? But even back then, they were 
spending over six hours doing code review. So obviously we wanted to know, is 
that beneficial for them? And so we were working with different teams and we 
could see that some teams are, you know, using code reviews better than others. 
So we wanted to distill best practices that we can then help other teams to 
adopt. Yeah, I've found this so fascinating when I was working at Microsoft 
because it's really a socio-technical, practice, right? So there's a lot of 
social skills that people have to bring to the table, but there's also a lot of 
technical skills that makeup the good code reviewer. Then there is also 
this process perspective, like, as a team, how are you actually doing code 
reviews? And there's so many unknowns, right? A lot of people thinking 
about the testing strategy. A lot of people, engineers, are thinking about, 
you know, 'how do you write code?' They're doing a lot of trainings in that area, 
but code reviews, I think, is something that has picked up a lot of steam.
A lot of companies adopted that practice, but there isn't a lot of 
great information out there. There isn't a lot of training out there that 
teaches people how to actually do code reviews effectively. And there are 
things that you should know! So this is where I saw actually a little 
bit, like a "hole" in the market. A space that I could fill in that I 
had a lot of knowledge. I had a lot of passion also for this topic. And so 
this is actually how I came about during my code reviews workshops and 
writing my code reviews book that, you know, I'm writing right now. What's on 
my bucket list as well: I want to also develop a tool in that space. I
hope that end of this year, beginning of next year, I will really start with 
that idea, and bring that to life, and experiment with that. So, this brings me 
to the end of this episode. Let me know if you enjoyed it. Next episode, if it's 
just me talking again, will not be about my journey. 

[00:28:00] I thought maybe, you know, well, code reviews could be one 
thing like I'm telling you my perspective on how you can do code reviews 
more effectively. You can also talk about testing, for example, or other 
engineering topics. So everything that actually interests me a lot, and I have a 
lot of passion for, and that I hope will bring you also some joy and some 
interesting perspectives. So, have a good day! And talk to you in two weeks. Bye 
bye! 

I hope you enjoyed another episode of the Software Engineering Unlocked podcast. 
Don't forget to subscribe! And I talk to you again in two weeks. Bye!
