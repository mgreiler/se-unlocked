# Episode 37: Jenn Creighton


**Michaela:** [00:00:00] Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked 
podcast. I'm your host, Dr. McKayla, and today I have the pleasure to talk to 
Jenn Creighton, a staff engineer at Apollo. 

But before I start, I wanted to introduce you to a new company that sponsors 
today's episode Botany.io. 
The founders reached out to me to tell me about botany and virtual assistant and 
personal coach for engineers that helps you adopt better habits, improve your 
skills or automate your workflow.
You could, for example, set out to improve your code review skills, then botany 
would ping you each time a new code review is created that needs your 
expertise. By tracing and tracking your interactions and even feeding back 
information about the quality of your code review feedback, it gives you a 
data-driven and guided way to improve your skillset, habits and level up your 
career.
You know, I'm a big advocate of data-driven insights and the same time, a big sceptic, 
because I know that data can easily be misused or misinterpreted. 

I really liked Botany's approach of a personal coach for engineers, because if 
this disallows comparisons or stack ranks, but rather focuses on the strengths and 
personal growth path of each engineer. 

If this sounds interesting to you, please hop over to botany.io.
To request access to the tool that is botany.io. 
But now back to Jenn. 
Jenn is a 
senior staff engineer at Apollo graphQL, focusing on open source. She's also a 
frequent conference speaker and recently started her own podcast called single 
strategy. So I'm super happy to have Jenn here with me today. Jenn welcome to the show.

**Jenn:**  [00:01:36] 
Hi, thank you for having me super stoked. Hi there. 

**Michaela:** [00:01:41] It's my pleasure. So Jen. When I look at your profile, 
like I'm so impressed. It's like senior staff engineered. I mean, this sounds 
super impressive. So how did you get that far in your career? And also what is a 
senior staff engineer? What, what differentiates a senior staff engineer, for 
example, from a senior engineer, what are the different responsibilities?
Kilz? 

**Jenn:**  [00:02:04] It's funny when you say you feel impressed by. My resume. 
My first thought is like, ah, no. And then my second thought is, well, if you 
had shown baby Jen, this, during her initial start to her dev career, she also 
would have been really impressed and like kind of blown away. Because when I 
started this, I didn't know, there even was such a thing as a staff engineer or 
a principal or a senior staff or anything like that.
When I got started in development, I was just like, okay, I'll be a junior, then 
I'll be mid-level and then I'll be senior. And then. I don't know, like, I don't 
know what, what comes next. So really over the time that I have been in 
engineering, these titles started to become more popular. So it was the title of 
staff or the title of senior staff or principal.
And they're basically like senior, senior, senior problem, like senior seniors, 
senior titles that you just keep adding like a senior, basically to them is sort 
of how you could think about it. In some cases, they mean very specific things 
in various specific companies. So a principal at Microsoft might be very 
different from a staff engineer at Apollo graph QL.
It really depends on what those career development ladders like, look like. But 
essentially, I would say it's like, you're just keep adding like a senior to the 
title basically. And you just couldn't say I'm a senior, senior, senior at some 
point. It doesn't make sense. 

**Michaela:** [00:03:32] Well, so at Microsoft, the principal was, I mean, it 
wasn't definitely impressive.
And then I think there was a fellow, right? Like only really a few people, you 
know, were like brilliant people, no word prize people, at least in my 
impression, like. 

**Jenn:**  [00:03:47] No prize winners 

**Michaela:** [00:03:50] or prize winners. They are

**Jenn:**  [00:03:56] nowhere near that. I'm just still like, ah, for me, what 
my title means is that I'm, I'm highly specialized. So as you become more and 
more senior, you tend to become more and more specialized. You just can't be a 
generalist. And super senior in all the aspects of software engineering that you 
would need to be.
So you do have to specialize at some point, for me, being a senior staff means 
that I've chosen my specialization and that I'm continuing to grow and become 
more of an authoritative voice in that specialization in my company. 

**Michaela:** [00:04:31] And so what is that? It's react graph, QL, Java script, 
or. Yeah, how, how broad is such a specialization.

**Jenn:**  [00:04:40] It can really depend on what you're doing for me. My 
career was heading in a path of high specialization in just front end in 
general. So before I worked at a Apollo graph QL, I was at a company called the 
wing and I was a front end architect there. So I had gone from being a senior at 
a company called class pass, and then eventually joined the wing as a front end 
architect.
And you could think of the architect as like a staff engineer role. My job was 
to help the code base continue to be healthy and that involved, uh, touching all 
the parts of it. So from testing to the actual front end code, any sort of 
infrastructure that we needed build tools or anything like that, that was my, my 
specialization was starting to think about those types of things.
It's a little bit different at Apollo graph kale because I'm working on open 
source. Now I actually work on the Apollo client team. So my specialization is 
really about open-source and in particular Apollo client JavaScript and the 
very, very difficult problem of how front-end applications get data and cash 
data on the front end.

**Michaela:** [00:05:52] Okay. Yeah. And so when I think about, to be honest, be 
back at it, I don't know if it's like, just my verus was not there or the titles 
were not there, but as you said, for me, it was like, okay, you are maybe an 
intern, then you're a junior, then you're. But a developer, then you are a 
senior developer and then you are a manager.
I mean, this was also like how I understood it. Like yeah. And then you have to 
go and manage people and I think we are industry. So my, this is just like some, 
some theories around it. I want to know if you maybe have the same ideas, but 
maybe it has to do that more and more people complain. I mean, there are a lot 
of very brilliant engineers that are just not really good.
Managers. Right. And so if the next step from a senior engineer is to be a 
shitty manager, right. It's not good for the company and it's not good for the 
individual. And so maybe this is how old, the whole thing came about that, you 
know, loudly say, well, you want to advance and you know, like senior, senior 
sounds strange.
You don't want to be in management that actually we don't want you to be in 
management either. Right. So, so. And then at the same time, I think technology 
is, I mean, it's exploding, right? So I think where you could know a lot of the 
web technologies, 15 years back, or, you know, like, yeah, 15 years back. I 
mean, what was there like Perla, CGI, right.
A little bit of JavaScript, but now we have all these, you know, especially 
stations that you actually need to understand. Right. It's JavaScript, it's 
react. It's angular. There are so many other technologies out there. And so 
maybe it has to do with that. You actually have to, you have more room to grow 
as an engineer.
And so the titles reflect that, that room to grow, that there is so much that 
you actually have to know. What, what do you think about that? 

**Jenn:**  [00:07:41] I do think that is what has happened, because if you look 
over the past 10 years, And if you just look at just web development, the 
JavaScript side, things exploded into specializations because it wasn't just.
That single page applications became more, uh, popular that they started to be 
used more that the framework started to really build up. You also had no JS come 
into the mix. So there was server side JavaScript problems. So you really 
started to see a lot of specialization. And then as you started to really work 
on single page applications, getting really into depth with a framework or 
working on the server side.
There's other specializations in web development to, uh, having really good 
accessibility, right? Accessibility has come out as a specialization over the 
past 10 years that you can, you can focus on just that at your job. And that's 
already a really hard problem. So all these specializations came out that.
You couldn't be a generalist really any more, because you could never get fully 
into depth with something you could never be fully into testing into dev 
infrastructure into the server side, into a good practices with HTML, into being 
really good at CSS. Or single-page like none of that, like it's a huge breadth.
So you do have to start to specialize. And as you were saying, The path used to 
be. I go from junior to mid-level to senior to manager because we didn't have 
all these IC tracks, these individual contributor tracks for you to go into. And 
so that was your path. And for, you know, when I started out, that was kind of 
what I thought might happen to me too.
But thankfully all these more like larger individual contributor tracks came up, 
like being able to be an architect or focus on a system and become a staff 
engineer of that system so that, you know, we don't have, you have more leeway. 
Now, if you don't want to go into management because management is not a 
continuation of the engineering career track, it is a completely different.
Career track completely. Yeah, 

**Michaela:** [00:09:58] exactly. Yeah, exactly. So I think this is much more 
natural. I was also when I was at Microsoft, I think it was the first company 
that I thought, well, there's actually more, you know, like there's a long 
letter that I could climb whereby at other companies, I was like, Oh, do I want 
to become a manager?
No, where's the staff only no two hops and then you're there, then you're stuck 
forever. But so maybe what's also happened over the last 15 years is that if you 
look at all the companies that need engineers and all that. The websites that 
are built. They're not vibe sites anymore. They are bad applications.
Right. So first he was like, it's that exciting? So yeah, a front end engineer 
was somebody that no HTML and, you know, sprinkled some JavaScript on top. So 
that there's like a auto-fill or a button that you can click or some, some 
validation off, you know, that, that feels that you are filling in. And I mean, 
this is like 10 years ago.
Right? So most of the, this most already. Something, but now, I mean, it's a 
whole application. There's so much going on, right. There's architecture that 
you have to think about. There are so many technologies that are going on and 
every company almost has. Has an application, right? They don't want websites 
anymore.
I don't know. I mean, there are still a small businesses that get websites, but 
like every, every startup, every company that gets a little bit serious, they 
don't want a website. They want an application and the user can do something 
that it can log in. Can there's so much functionality. Right. So I think the 
whole, the work exploded for us as well.
Right? So the, the work and the need for, for people that really know their 
stuff and what they're 

**Jenn:**  [00:11:38] doing. It's not just that like small businesses also have 
websites too. There are now entire companies that their job is to make it easier 
for those businesses to have a website, you know, Squarespace, web flow.
And those are in themselves like really complex technologies that someone has to 
build. So it didn't really exploded. And like what type of work was available 
for engineers as well? 

**Michaela:** [00:12:03] Yeah. And I don't know. I mean, I looked at your 
LinkedIn profile and I saw that you have been actually quite, quite a few 
different organizations.
And so if you're looking back like the last 10 years, did you also see that it 
grew from while I was responsible for a website and do some, you know, like some 
HTML and some sprinkle, a little bit JavaScript to now I'm, I'm doing full blown 
applications with so much functionality. Is that something that.
I mean only because you know, more, but also probably because the companies, the 
requirements for the stack and for the technologies changed over time. How do 
you see that? 

**Jenn:**  [00:12:41] Yeah. So when I started out, my, my first job ever in this 
field was that I worked at Ralph Lauren in their marketing department. And so 
what we were building was just.
Plain websites, HTML, CSS, and maybe a little bit of JavaScript functionality, 
but nothing really heavy. This was not using a single page, web application, no 
framework or anything like that. It was good old jQuery back in the day and like 
a, a smidge of it really when I left Ralph Lauren, even actually, while I was at 
Ralph Lauren.
The want from the client to do more interactive, fun things for people became 
more and more of a thing, more interaction, more information that you could get 
without having to go to a secondary page. Right? So that actually was already 
starting to be a trend there. When I left, I left to go work on more single the 
webpage applications.
I was starting to work in a field of, of actually building out really large 
applications. So the first job I went to after that was a company called loverly 
and it was essentially like a Pinterest, but focused solely on weddings. Right. 
And then from there I went to go work at Chartbeat and I brush over levelly 
because, because the company didn't do well, but Chartbeat is actually where you 
could really see that.
We were trying to push like what you could do on a webpage forward, because 
Chartbeat was an application for people who work at new sites to get analytics 
about their articles. And they were starting to do a lot more interesting things 
like experiments on headlines or being able to rearrange the page to see the 
flow of content and what might actually be like, w you want to push it up to the 
top of the page that required a lot more.
Overlays on top of things, a lot more consideration about how to do those 
things, how to not have people like click through to just like a graph, you 
know? And that was where I started to see like a big, a much bigger explosion at 
that time of angular react, all these things that would allow you to interact 
with a page without having to like leave the page, how to get the data to you 
without having to like move through and understand the flow of a webpage in the 
same way that you used to.
So that that's when I saw that sort of exponential growth and every job since 
then was a really in depth application, something more intensive than what's 
that Chartbeat. Yeah. That was around 2015. So that was, I think the angular had 
just become popular. And as I was leaving Chartbeat, we were putting react in 
place.

**Michaela:** [00:15:30] Yeah. And so another thing that when I looked through 
your LinkedIn and I don't, I'm not a star
is that I started you. Left the job. And you moved on every one to two years, 
right. Which is very like out of the textbook. Right. But which we hear very 
often that if you want to advance your career to something like a senior staff 
engineer, maybe this is something that you should consider doing what is also 
why you, you know, why you changed so frequently your, your roles or over other 
things that, you know, motivated you to move in that pace.

**Jenn:**  [00:16:12] There were a few reasons for those hops. My, my father is 
very old school and he's very confused by my job habit. Think like his joke is 
like every time he talks to me, I have a new job. And dad, but my dad came from 
a generation where like, you stay in your job for probably your whole life. Like 
that's my dad's generation.
You literally work one job for all of your life. So this is a very weird concept 
to him. And I've had to try to explain to him, like, in some cases, because I 
choose to work in startups in particular, that can go badly very quickly. So 
some of the startups that I worked for ran out of money. Or they had layoffs and 
the company changed in the time that I was there.
Then you have this other really, but I think that's sort of very, very 
particular to tech, which is that it is hard to advance if you don't move around 
of the nine-ish years that I have been in tech, I have only ever been promoted 
once. That's it. Every other time to get to the next level. I had to leave my 
current company to work with the type of JavaScript applications that I want to 
work with.
I had to leave Ralph Lauren to advance to a senior. I had to leave previous 
companies cause I wasn't going to get a promotion there. I had to leave and go 
somewhere else. And to keep moving up into the type of work that I wanted to do. 
I also had to leave. So if I wanted to be a front end architect, I couldn't do 
that at my previous company.
I wanted to move on very specifically to a smaller startup, where there was room 
for me to take on that role, instead of trying to like. Get into that role at my 
current company, I didn't think that was going to work. Right. So in a lot of 
cases, it's also that, and also I have moved because I've been underpaid, I've 
been under leveled.
Those are all reasons to like move on one of the side effects that actually I'm 
really happy about from this moving on is that I was exposed. To a lot of code 
bases that were written very differently and different technical choices were 
made along the way. And I got to experience what it meant to work in those 
systems.
Which meant I got a lot of comparison out of the different systems. I could 
figure out why patterns were good or not good. I could decide what I would want 
to try out in my role as a front end architect and eventually decided what I 
really want to be doing is going very heavy into open source libraries right now 
that that's where my head space is at.
But yeah, it was like being able to do that, get that kind of like knowledge at 
each job actually did really help. So. Job hopping in our field is, is, can 
happen for a lot of reasons. Not all of those reasons are bad. They can be bad, 
but not all of them are. 

**Michaela:** [00:19:12] Yeah. Actually, when I looked through your LinkedIn, I 
was like, Oh my God, I could ask her so many things about, you know, different 
technologies, different software engineering practices, because if you are, you 
know, like at a couple of, I mean, if you're, I've only worked at one company, 
it doesn't matter which company it is.
Right. You only experience one style of doing things. And so now you have really 
disadvantage of knowing well code reviews, you know, over there. Maybe at Ralph 
Lauren, it didn't exist. I imagine. Yeah,
exactly. Uh, but now we'll probably do, and maybe at the job before they also 
did, but they were done in a different way and you can compare actually what 
works and what doesn't work. So you are actually also coming here. I mean, you 
bring. A lot of perspective, a lot of knowledge that is super valuable, I think, 
for the new employer with you.
Right. So how do you see those things? Like testing, code reviews, CIC D is 
there something that you think that, well, this is the right way to do it, and 
that's the wrong way to do it at my current, my current insight level, right. 

**Jenn:**  [00:20:20] As I have gone along in my career. One of the funny things 
that has happened is I have become less convinced of the right way of doing 
things earlier in my career.
I definitely had this perspective that there was a right way to do things. And 
as I've gone on and experienced how people do things differently, what their 
trade-offs are. I started to understand that there was no right way or wrong 
way. It was just about what trade-offs you wanted to make. So I don't have as 
hard of opinions about things as maybe some other engineers based off of this 
experience of, of understanding what people value differently in their system.
There are some things that I still like I really care about and I want to do 
very well. So if I was working on a product team, still, my focus would be on 
react component architecture. And I do have some rules that guide me, but 
they're not hard and fast. If you can find a reason to break them, break the 
rule.
I don't care. You just got to give me like why you broke it. Totally fine with 
me. Some of the stuff that has surprised me about what I've actually. So as I've 
gone on my technical opinions have become less strict. But my opinions on the 
other types of work that we do, code reviews, communication, those types of 
things that has become more strict, that's become more like what, what I 
perceive as the quote unquote right way to do things.
And it's based less off of correctness and more off of the environment that I 
want to work in. And what makes me happy. Because I've discovered how very 
important that is to me, it's important to have nice coworkers and it's 
important not to feel like code reviews are a battle. You fight every day 
straight.
Exactly. 

**Michaela:** [00:22:22] Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And so, to me, it sounds a little bit 
that very often you are reaching a glass ceiling at one of your companies. Do 
you think that has to do more with the fact that these are. Small organizations, 
startups that don't have like the room to have, you know, to advance at the pace 
maybe that you want to advance, or they don't have the need for, you know, 
someone more experienced.
It's like, yeah. Yeah. So yeah. So the structure. Yeah, exactly. Right. If you 
have like five engineers, you probably don't need the principal engineer. Right. 
So you have like, Sure. Maybe they are all just engineers. Maybe it's not, 
maybe, maybe it has a senior engineer and the other are engineers and maybe a 
junior, but you probably don't need, like, if they're five ones, five different 
title for everybody.
Do you think that this is the reason, or was there something else at play that 
you think people are, you know, you also talked about underpaying, which happens 
quite often. In the startup world as well, right? Yeah. Undervaluing maybe as 
well. Do you think that it has to do more with the startup world? Or do you 
think that very often, we also hear that, that for example, it has to do with 
gender at a no you're undermined because of your gender or do you have like a 
feeling why it's happening and probably have quite, quite some insights for 
yourself or you thought, well, they collected some evidence why it's happening.
And this is what I think the root cause 

**Jenn:**  [00:23:52] of that is now. I'll never be able to say a hundred 
percent that I know why it's happening, but over my time, I have some 
inclination sometimes to be completely fair. Sure. You work at a really small 
startup and there just isn't, it's just not going to happen, but that wasn't the 
case at most of the places that I worked at, most of the places that I worked 
at, I came in underpaid or under leveled or both.
And some of that has to do with the fact that in tech, honestly, well, 
throughout the world, right? They want to get the labor for as cheap as they 
possibly can. But in tech, you are already undervalued by who you present us. So 
if you're not a white dude that went to Stanford, you just present differently 
and.
People have assigned a value to you, whether they are aware of it or not. And 
that does come into play a lot of people. When I say something like this that 
maybe you're getting undervalued or underpaid based off of your gender or that 
you're a marginalized person in tech, you come from a non-white background, for 
instance, or you come from a working class background.
They're very quick to say, well, I've, I've seen this happen with also a white 
man. I've seen this also happened with a dude and it's not that it doesn't, it 
absolutely does because it's pervasive in tech in general, but it does happen on 
average, more to specific genders and marginalized identities. If you were to 
listen to our stories about, I can tell you every single job, I was almost all 
of my jobs.
I've been underpaid except for some recent ones. And it wasn't because I didn't 
negotiate. It was because they said, this is what we're going to give you. And 
that's your option. They didn't want to negotiate with me. Or I was punished for 
negotiation. I was under level. Despite my years of experience, I was.
I had been at a company for a year and a half. I was a mid-level dev. I was 
starting to edge towards senior, but couldn't figure out how to get there 
because I wasn't getting the assignments. I needed to stretch myself into that 
role. And I was called a junior after a year and a half of that company. Why I 
like.
If you don't give me the assignments I need to, to advance, I'm going to get 
stuck in the same role. And why didn't I get the assignments that you were 
giving other people I spoke up and I asked for them, I do the things that you're 
told that you're like, if you just act like X, you're going to get what you 
want.
If you just ask for it and negotiate, blah, blah, blah, you will get treated 
like you are a man in tech. That is not true. That is just certainly false. You 
will not, there are rules in place. For how you are supposed to behave and you 
are not supposed to ask for the thing that you want, you will get punished for 
it.
Yeah. And again, like I said, I've only ever been promoted once. 

**Michaela:** [00:27:02] Yeah. When I was at Microsoft, I recall like one of the 
first weeks that I'm sitting with the team and they're at the lunch table and 
they're studying, talking about, I don't know, some tech. Problem. Right. And 
the manager starts to apologize to me that they're talking about Tasha and about 
complicated things.
Right. I was like, Oh, it's okay. I can handle the conversation. And then it was 
after I finished my PhD. Right. A very technical PhD. I was actually the only 
one with a PhD on the table. And they were like, yeah. And it continued, it 
never stopped it. Never. I tell you, it never stopped with this round of people.
They kept on apologizing that they are talking about technical things. Like, Oh, 
sorry. You must be so bored. We will stop the topic very soon. I mean, at one 
point I just gave up, but because what I going to say, right. And obviously if 
that's the mindset you're not included, right. So they are not including me, 
even in the conversation, you cannot even say something about like you would 
have, I understand this.
I understood the last sentence that you said, like the thing that you're talking 
about, but yeah. They decided 

**Jenn:**  [00:28:21] what you could handle. They already decided what was 
there. 

**Michaela:** [00:28:25] Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You don't, you don't need to try 
to belong right. Or to fit in or to, you know, impress them. I mean, you always 
have to impress the surrounding, right.
That they are impressed that you know, that, I mean, and, and you cannot even 
ask. I mean, what I find really interesting, and I don't know if you experienced 
that, but I find it really difficult to ask questions because it's assumed that 
I have no idea about anything. Right. And so instead of having like the next 
upper, like, if you're, if you're, if you're questioning, for example, a best 
practice, it's assumed that you have no idea about the best practice per se.
Right. And so they started really at the, at the bottom of explaining what the 
thing is about. Instead of understanding that you're actually questioning you 
understand very well, you know, what led to that best practice and all the 
different things, but you're questioning the best practice per se. Right.
And so, yeah, I totally understand what you're saying here. And yeah, it's very 
unfortunate. There was also Kelly, Alice that I follow on Twitter. She recently 
talked about her. Experiences and MailChimp. Right. And it was, it was a very 
unfair treatment in that she is a principal engineer. I was also so impressed, 
like a principal engineer.
Right. But that she had the lowest salary of all her male colleagues. And so 
when she brought that up, what happened is that she was punished, right. She's 
not working for my team anymore, which I think it's, it's the same. Like if you 
are, if you are talking about those things that are happening, it's really 
risky.
It's really risky. I mean, you're. You're getting punished for what you're. 
Yeah. You're talking about your, your gas lighted with what happened to you, 
right. The experiences and so on. So I dunno, how do you do that for example, 
with Twitter, right. So do you share openly, do you dare to share what happened 
to you or if you're.
Uncomfortable somewhere. I mean, right now, I mean, there are a lot of things. 
There's also, for example, what happens at Google AI, right. With all the 
firings that's going on with people that are actually speaking up. Right. Do you 
have a big following as well? Do you speak up and, and how, and how does that 
impact you?
For example, 

**Jenn:**  [00:30:38] I have never felt comfortable while I'm going through the 
thing to speak up, Kelly. Kelly being able to go out there and say this. And, 
and I I'm, I don't think I would have her bravery and her strength to do that 
while I'm going through the thing. She, she was very poorly treated, very 
underpaid, and she came out and said it very blatantly about what had happened 
to her.
The thing is even when you tell people your experiences in tech, Unless they are 
of that same underrepresented group or marginalized identity. A lot of people 
don't want to believe that it's happening there. If they believe that it's 
happening, if they believe that there are reasons that you get under leveled and 
underpaid that have nothing to do with your merit, your actual worth in the 
field, it does undercut their own worth.
Their own, how did I get here? Everyone wants to think that they did the thing 
by themselves. They were just good enough to get by. They worked really hard and 
accomplished it. Nobody wants to admit that just by the value of how they look 
or how they act, they got ahead quicker than somebody else. So to have that them 
like acknowledge that that had happened to you, what would undercut that for 
themselves?
And they don't want to do that. Yeah. The thing that particularly strikes me 
about Kelly's what's happened to Kelly is that it does show too that no matter 
how ahead you get in the field, no matter what title you get or how well-known 
you are, because Kelly also is very well known, has a very large following.
Yes, you can get treated this way. There's nothing that protects you from being 
treated this way in tech. It's one of the striking things for me about her 
experience is that no matter how high up you get, no matter how technical you 
are, no matter your following, no matter what, you can have a company treat you 
like this.
I have never been brave enough during those times to stay to say like, this is 
what I'm going through. It is always after the fact. And I'm very, very careful 
with it. I recently, like when Kelly was going through this, it, I saw a lot of 
people on Twitter being like, well, this happens to men too. And so I wrote out 
a tweet.
That was one of the things I had experienced earlier in my career, which was 
that I was on a team that interviewed a very senior site, reliability engineer. 
And it was a woman that we interviewed the hiring manager was. One of the head 
engineers. It was a very small startup. And when he was talking about her 
towards the end of the process, he gave it to us like a plus that he literally 
said she doesn't know her worth because she's a woman, so we can get her for 
cheaper.
And I, I, and I wanted to put it out into the world because it's just a little 
bit of like, no dude, like. I promise you that if you think this isn't 
happening, if you think it also happens to men, there's a whole group of people 
in tech who genuinely believed this shit. And we'll go on to do this at other 
companies, right.
He's at another company now. And I'm pretty sure he's probably doing the same 
shit there. And he did other stuff. Like he was, he was. Not a good dude and I 
want to put that out there, but I still don't feel comfortable naming the 
company, naming the person. I am still very protective of that information, uh, 
because I can start a firestorm that I'm not, I'm not prepared for.
And there are other things that have happened to me in tech that I've just kind 
of slowly leaked out onto Twitter. But I'm careful about like naming names and 
naming companies. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid. I probably sh I don't know if I should 
be, but I am like, I don't want to kick up a whole thing. I also don't in a lot 
of cases have, have proof.
Like, I don't have emails and stuff, like later, actually in my career, when I 
started to have issues with people like this in the field actually did start to 
collect evidence. I maybe didn't go to HR because maybe there was no HR where I 
was, or I didn't trust them, but I did start to collect evidence. So later I 
actually do have like a little evidence box of, like you said, this thing to me 
and I have it, but I still, I still don't feel comfortable speaking out all the 
time.
And I do get calls on Twitter sometimes to be like, well, name the company. I'm 
like, no, I kind of weighed the value of naming the company with the cost of 
naming the company. And to me, it didn't, it didn't make sense, so I didn't do 
it. So, yeah, I'm, I'm still very nervous to say those things out loud. 

**Michaela:** [00:35:45] Yeah, and I totally got it because I think I'm in the 
complete same boat.
Right. I think that it has to do with that. You're still, I mean, to be honest, 
my, my estimate or my prediction is that if you're naming that right, It 
doesn't, it doesn't do any good. Right? It doesn't do any good for you. And even 
if you have like your proof box box is worth nothing a little bit, like, sorry 
to say, but I really think that if you're going public, if people want to 
discredit you, they discredit you.
And so they will say, Oh, this is just because you're not really a good 
engineer. Right. So this is why you couldn't level up or yeah, you experienced 
that, but you know, You just misinterpreted what they were saying, right. They 
weren't saying really, you know, doubt or there wasn't actually to be nice to 
you.
Why can't you be happy about it? And, and I think, I think. I'm also very 
careful with what I say. And, and sometimes I want to be this really brave 
person that, you know, shares blandly, you know, what happens or what I, what I 
saw what happened to me, for example, over the last 15 years. And there are so 
many things that you're just like, yeah, it's, it's unbelievable.
But the question is what, what's the positive outcome from that, right? Maybe 
there's this a viral tweet where I attract a lot of people that are negative 
against me. Right. That send me maybe hate emails or, you know yeah. And then 
somehow this will outweigh the, the few positives and, and also I'm thinking.
What will others, you know, what will others get positive out of it? And I'm not 
sure. And maybe this is a problem that needs to be solved, right? So how can we 
create a space where you can safely talk about those things and we can create 
positive change out of it. Right? Because now how I experienced that this is now 
limited to Twitter, for example, is that, well, there's a space.
You can tell it, right. But then you're completely unprotected and everything 
can completely backfire and you have no. There's no momentum. I mean, I don't 
think that the chances that anything that I'm saying, um, that this recreates a 
momentum and positive change is isn't there. I don't see it. I don't see it.
I just see the negative consequences with knocking myself, maybe out of this 
industry, which would be the worst thing that could happen. Right. So if you're 
standing, if I'm standing, I think this is probably. The best chance or the best 
change direction. Right. So that you're still here. And I mean, it's a harder 
way, and you are changing every year and a half or two, right.
Your, your career. But on the other hand, you are a senior staff engineer and a 
lot of others are impressed by that. Right. And so I think that, and I think. 
This is, this is also very important. Yeah. I would love to be, you know, to 
have a space where we could talk more openly, but there should be also positive 
change coming from it.
Not negative. Negative influences. Yeah. I, this is, 

**Jenn:**  [00:38:45] yeah. The only reason I'll I'll say I don't, I don't have 
a good solution either. I just know that like, I don't do, I don't say the 
things I say on Twitter when I do like spill some tea. I don't do it out of 
wanting to take a company down or take a person down because that is, that is 
outside of my, my, my comfort zone.
That's not what my aim is. It doesn't usually go very well. If you look at women 
who speak up about even worse things, You hear women who speak up about rape or 
sexual assault, and you see what happens to them. You don't even want to speak 
up about the misogyny you experienced in your early career or, or whatever is 
happening to you because you know of what the cost is going to be.
So my mindset has always, I'm not, I'm not there to take down a company or take 
down a percent. I'm there to put out a little bit of what I have experienced in 
the hopes that one, if you're not like me, if you don't look like me, if you're 
a white dude in tech, you maybe. Believe me. And that would be nice.
And you, and you understand that this is happening and maybe you are rallied to 
become more of an ally to women and marginalized identities in your, in your 
company. And to look out for them and to stand with them. If they do want to 
speak out and to, if you are a woman and you have experienced this, I want you 
to know that it's, it is happening.
I don't want you to be gas lit. I find that the gas lighting is one of the more 
disorienting things. Did to say your, your truthful experience and then have 
someone tell you back. That is not how it goes. This is not what happens. Oh, 
that happens to men too. It wasn't about gender is so disorienting and so 
demoralizing.
So those are the reasons that I, that I like try and put it out there. And then, 
like you said, like my other thing is like, I'm just going to keep going. I'm 
just going to keep going in tech. You cannot push me out. You're not going to do 
it. No, I'm going to keep going. I'm going to amass technical knowledge because 
that is what I love to do.
And I'm going to keep amassing power and influence at companies that I go to. 
And I'm going to use that. To, to create change at my companies to create change 
for other people. I'm going to be out there as a speaker and a conference 
speaker so that people will see me on stage and know that other people can do 
it.
And at some point I'll take a step back and I'll put other people on stage like 
that. That is, that is my mentality for this, this whole thing that I'm doing a 
mass of the power. Give out the power. That's my motto. 

**Michaela:** [00:41:34] Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's also very aligned with what I 
try to do, but I just keep going and then, you know, paving a little bit the way 
and, and speaking up in the situation.
Right. So if you are, for example, in a hiring event, I think there is a right 
place to speak up, right? So this is the place where I can say, well, this was. 
Two totally biased decision to say, you know, for example, this decision against 
the woman that could actually very nicely fit into our role here, and you just 
discredit her with this little, whatever she sat, right.
I mean, whatever she says is wrong, right? So I think this is the right place, 
right? To say this is biased or this isn't right. Or there should be more, you 
know, there should be in the hiring committee, there should be more women 
actually, or more minorities, or we don't have. We don't have, you know, people 
from that background to speak up and say, well, there's something happening.

**Jenn:**  [00:42:28] Yeah. What you're saying too, like it's to be very clear, 
there are people who speak up and we need them. And there are people who work 
from the inside and we need them. It's all across the board. Right? So wherever 
you feel comfortable trying to make change in, in your own way, do it, you don't 
have to do the same thing that everyone else is doing, that everyone thinks you 
should do.
If everyone thinks you should name a chain, that's maybe not the best thing for 
you, you know? 

**Michaela:** [00:42:56] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see. I see, I see it exactly the 
same way. Right? So there are so many and we have to play to our strengths. 
Right. Sometimes I feel really bad for me that, you know, I'm not there shouting 
from the roof, whatever, but I also know I wouldn't last long and that's not 
good.
I need my, yeah. It's like this. Right. And I think we need me and you to last, 
right. We should be there and people should see. And. No experience running a 

**Jenn:**  [00:43:24] marathon, but you're not running. Exactly. Yeah. It is a 
marathon. And so if you need to sometimes like, yeah, not also engage in things 
at work. Like if, if your company's doing things that you wish they would 
change, but you are burning out.
It's okay. It's okay. Not to engage. Please take care of yourself because the 
people in tech that we need to see for the longterm, you have to protect 
yourself to make it that far. 

**Michaela:** [00:43:50] Yeah, exactly. And I think, I mean, what you say 
diversity again, right. I think even here diversity is so important. Right. We 
need the engineer and maybe it's a very, you know, I don't know a person that 
doesn't, you know, it's not a, no, she or he is not involved in diversifying the 
company because they are really involved in getting a hat and, and being the 
principal, principal principal at that company.
Right. And then, yeah. Hopefully they will lift others up as well. Right. And 
not only thinking about their own way in their own success, but how to pave the 
way for others to, to be there and, and be represented at that company, but in a 
different way, they are not sitting in the meetings because it's not their 
strengths.
Right. And I think that's, that's totally fine. And that's okay as well. Yeah. 
We really need different various diversity. Yes. 

**Jenn:**  [00:44:40] Yeah. It's a hard lesson that I had to learn early on, 
which was. Get, like I said, gain the power, gain the technical expertise, gain 
the respect. Then you can start to spend it on the things that you want to, but 
first you ha you have to do that.
It was, I made the mistake of going in and being like very, I'm a woman in tech 
and we're going to change things and quickly realizing that I couldn't get 
anyone to move on any of these initiatives until I gained a certain amount of 
respect, technically, which is unfair. But I had to do it. There just wasn't 
another way for me.

**Michaela:** [00:45:19] Yeah, definitely. I think so, too. Yeah. So this is a 
heavy topic.

**Jenn:**  [00:45:29] topic, right? It's such a go deep into yeah. 

**Michaela:** [00:45:32] Deep dive. Yeah. It's a heavy topic and I mean, there's 
so many things that you can do wrong as well about it, right? So you get also a 
hate for everything that you're doing a little bit. Like you're the one that's 
shouting from the roof is getting hay because they're doing it.
The one that are not shouting from the roof, they're getting hit because they're 
not doing it. And so on. It's a little bit like topic without love, but it's 
important topics. So I was really happy to talk with you and share your 
experience and share a little bit of mine as well, which. I think there is 
overlap, even though we have very different, you know, different paths in.
Yeah. So maybe the last thing to just end the whole episode on a very positive 
note is I wanted to talk a little bit about the podcast. So you started, you 
recently started a podcast. Yeah. And it's called single strata too. What are 
you talking about there? What's the focus. 

**Jenn:**  [00:46:25] So single threaded is a podcast where I'm taking a 
seasonal approach to it because there's a lot of things that I'm very interested 
in tech and every season I'm going to come up with a theme that I want to deep 
dive into with people.
And this first season really came out of wanting to discuss. A lot of feelings 
in tech, things that we don't like always talk about out loud and on Twitter or 
in other podcasts or in conference talks, but they are the side conversations 
that I almost always have with people, which is, tell me how code reviews make 
you feel.
Tell me how a certain technology makes you feel and why you feel that way. So 
we're exploring all of that. This season, and it has been a lot of fun and it's 
been a big learning experience on how to make a podcast. 

**Michaela:** [00:47:17] Okay. You're very cool. Very, yeah, I imagine. So 
there's actually a part I'm doing, I'm giving code review workshops, right?
And so one part, not all of them are same, but the ones that have some 
communication lessons or sections in down, right. And that are going a little 
bit deeper. They talk their talk about nonviolent communication, which is an 
excellent framework that I can recommend to everybody. It's like an algorithm 
that you can do to.
Understand conflict and resolve conflicts, uh, much better. And I like the 
algorithmic way of thinking about it. But anyway, one part of it is about 
talking about feelings and I find it's always really tricky. Like I have like 
this. So what kind of feelings do you like you have? Right. I mean, I think it's 
really hard to talk about feelings even for myself, right?
Like there are not, we don't have so many words for feelings. There may be 
happy, sad, angry. And I don't know if he's confused, even a feeling right. And 
then there's a stop. Like maybe you can come up with 10. I actually have a sheet 
with like, I don't know, over 150 feelings. Right. And it's like, there's so 
much nuance, but very often it's I have difficulties understanding if I'm angry 
or frustrated.
Right. That's the difference here. So what are the feelings that people have 
about technologies? Is it just happy and angry or is it like more nuanced here? 

**Jenn:**  [00:48:38] It's very nuanced. It's very nuance because things can 
make you angry while also making you happy. Like, I think people think that you 
have like one individual feeling and then you can move on to having the next 
individual feeling, but they're all, they're sort of like layers.
And so you can have like your primary feelings, some secondary things. It's why 
we have like, Words to describe like nostalgia, right? Nostalgia is a very 
layered feeling of a happiness about remembering something, but a sadness that 
it has passed. And so it is a, it's a layered emotion. I find people tend to 
have very layered emotions about things, but also my favorite thing is it, they 
have very strong feelings about things.
Which is funny. How has it been in engineering? You kind of are expected not to 
have certain feelings. You are like, expect it to be very logic based and you 
know, a little bit emotionless when you're working on code, but actually you 
have very strong feelings all the time. Like debugging debugging is extremely 
frustrating for a lot of people and it brings up a lot of emotional feelings 
hitting your head against a wall or the complete and utter relief when you 
solve.
The bug, like these are very, very strong things that you feel, these aren't 
small emotions. 

**Michaela:** [00:50:01] Yeah. Yeah. I can totally see it. I have to listen to 
your podcast, I think. And if there's like one specific episode about culture, 
views and feelings, I mean, this is the one that I definitely listen to probably 
10 times later 

**Jenn:**  [00:50:15] I did, I did have just a recent I'm actually editing it 
right now where we talked about code reviews and sort of what drives my guests.
You know, sort of batty about them or how they, how they have changed their 
minds, that around them to be from a code quality thing to a communication tool 
and how, how much that changes, like how you, how you perceive and how you work 
in code reviews. It's pretty interesting. 

**Michaela:** [00:50:39] Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I should definitely check that out.
Okay. So I will link everything in the show notes. Is there something that you 
want to say to my listeners before I let you go? 

**Jenn:**  [00:50:50] It was lovely to be here. Thank you for having me on, if 
anyone wants to follow me on Twitter, my handle is girl code girl with the you 
and I, I love meeting new followers and hanging out with people.
So come say hi to me sometime. Yeah, sounds good. 

**Michaela:** [00:51:04] Okay. So Jen, thank you so much. You enjoy the rest of 
your Sunday and thank you so much for joining today. And bye bye. Bye-bye I hope 
you enjoyed another episode of the sup engineering unlocked podcast. Don't 
forget to subscribe. And I talk to you again in two weeks.
Bye.
