# Transcript Episode 04 with Leif Singer

**Michaela:** [00:00:00] Hello, and welcome to the Software Engineering Unlocked 
podcast, where I talk to experienced developers from different companies about 
how to develop software. I'm your host, Dr. McKayla, and today I have the pleasure
to be talking to Dr. Leif Singer, who is a software engineer at Automattic. I'm 
really excited to have Leif here today to hear how his life is at a fully remote 
company. Leif is like me, passionated about improving software engineering, 
processes and tools. 

His specific interest is understanding how lightweight processes can help to 
collaborate better. He has a PhD in software engineering, but is also a science 
fiction writer and a musician. So I'm thrilled that Leif is here today. Leif 
welcome. How are you?

**Leif:** [00:00:44] Good morning, Mikayla. Thanks for having me. I'm good, 
thanks. 

**Michaela:** [00:00:47] I'm glad that you're here. So Leif let's start at the 
beginning. We actually met when we both were working and living in well, 
beautiful Victoria in Canada, precisely at the university of Victoria, where you 
worked as a postdoctoral researcher.
Now we live in Germany and work as a engineers of engineer at Automattic. That's 
quite some change. So yeah. Why did you change from academia to industry and how 
did you start working at Automattic? 

**Leif:** [00:01:13] Wow. Okay. You're you're starting with the tough questions, 
interesting. So you know that, but not everyone might know that, a postdoc 
position is a research position at a university that is supposed to prepare you 
for the job hunt for a professorship, right? 

So, I did the post doc because I thought I wanted to become a 
professor. But when I worked as a postdoc with two supervisors who were 
themselves already professors. I realized that academia was after all, not for 
me. The amount of time that I saw my superiors, and my colleagues too, put in, far 
exceeded what I thought was reasonable.

They loved their jobs. So they worked on weekends and things like 
that, right. And I, as a father of a young family, I didn't see myself doing 
that regularly in the near future. And that was first thing that crossed my 
mind. And then a few other things came together with us living in a, in a 
different country, far away from home with no support network of our own with a 
small son. And in the end, we decided to cut the Postdoc short at one year and 
moved back home. 

**Michaela:** [00:02:35] Okay. So it was actually supposed to go longer?

**Leif:** [00:02:38] Yes, it was supposed to take two years, but I talked to my 
supervisor and she was all right with me cutting it short for one year. 

**Michaela:** [00:02:48] One of the things you also addressed a little bit was
that you were living in a different country. And I also traveled and lived in 
different countries over the time, but I always had the feeling that I couldn't 
choose it. But at the point that you want to become a professor, it's somehow 
out of your hands a little bit. It's not like you can say, well, I want to 
become a professor in Germany. That's really a very difficult task.

**Leif:** [00:03:10] Right. You can't be choosy at that point. You 
have to just move where the jobs are, and that was definitely part of our 
decision. 

**Michaela:** [00:03:18] I totally understand that. So then you made this 
decision and what happened next? What was the next thing that you went on to do 
after your postdoc?

**Leif:** [00:03:27] I didn't have a plan. So I looked for a job and I found a 
remote job at a small company called IDoneThis. And it's a small app. When I 
joined, it was me and four others who worked on that app, it was really small, 
based mostly in New York. I worked there for, I suppose, one and a half or two 
years almost when the founders at some point, decided that they want to sell the 
company. And that's when I started looking for a new job because the buyers didn't
want to buy the team, only the product and the customer base. 

**Michaela:** [00:04:09] That's a bummer, probably, if you put part of your heart 
in there. 

**Leif:** [00:04:12] Yes. Yes, definitely. It was a bummer, but in the end it 
turned out that Automattic were some of our customers. So I got an intro from 
our CEO to one of Automattic's, basically the person who managed the Automattic 
account. And that's how I even thought about applying to Automattic and how I 
found out about this company. So in the end, it turned out to be a nice 
circumstance. 

**Michaela:** [00:04:42] When you were interviewing, then, for Automattic, did you 
have the skillset that was needed for that position or did you have to adjust there?

**Leif:** [00:04:50] So Automattic is the company behind Wordpress.com. And as 
such, externally I would have assumed that you need to know PHP and WordPress 
development. I had not developed a single WordPress plugin or theme before 
applying. I did have a few years of experience with PHP when I was doing my 
bachelor's at University, I basically worked on the side as a PHP freelancer, 
but when I went through my trial, at Automattic, you go through a trial over the 
course of one or two months where you work on basically a real project. I worked 
on a React app that was not released at that time. It is now it has now been 
released as the front end or, well, the administrative backend for Wordpress.com. 
So, pretty much a replacement for the WP admin, part of things written in React 
JS with Redux, server side rendered with Node, lots of buzzwords in there.
And I had never heard of anything from those technologies before I started 
working on that, but that was also part of the process. I believe of the trial 
process to see how I learn, how I adjust to new technologies and things like 
that. What kind of questions I ask.

**Michaela:** [00:06:11] Okay that's really interesting. So you started with this,
maybe let us look at a little bit at this trial, because I think it's very 
specific to Automattic how they hire, right? But once you explained that, maybe 
look at that you actually started that without prior knowledge of the technology. 
I think that's really mind blowing somehow. I really liked that concept, but yeah, 
it can be frightening. I can imagine.

**Leif:** [00:06:32] It really was. And actually, I don't think  it's that 
common so I can see someone of what current trials are working on and it's 
much more matched to their skillset. So I suppose I got lucky in an earlier 
time of the company where that was possible right now. I think we are trying
to standardize a bit because we really need to scale up hiring. And that is 
much easier when you have one approach that works. 

**Michaela:** [00:07:04] So how does this such a trial look like at Automattic 
right now, if I want to have a job at Automattic, what do I have to do?

**Leif:** [00:07:09] Right. So at first you send an email, you, or it might have 
changed, actually, maybe you fill out a form, we're starting to use the tool for 
managing those applications as well. Anyway, you write in with your CV and a 
cover letter. And at some point, hopefully soon, you hear back with hopefully a 
yes, we'd be interested.

And then you do an interview over text. So. I believe we use Slack nowadays, you 
get invited out. Yes. It's a text chat. And you basically talk for about 
an hour where you're being asked about your career, about some technical things. 
So it's basically a screener where we try to figure out whether it would be a 
good match thinking wise technology wise, things like that.

If that chat works out well. You get invited to do a small project that should 
take, I don't know, the actual times right now, but I think it's about four or 
five hours that you need to put in over a week where you get a small piece of 
code that you are supposed to improve with specific instructions. "Hey, is this
code secure", "What if we add this and that feature, could you do that?". Things
like that. And that's, I think we call that a code test, but if that works out 
also, then you get to do a trial, which can take anywhere from one month to two
months. Some I've also taken longer. You get assigned a real project that we 
really want to use and sometimes you're part of an actual team. 

You get to know a few of your possible future colleagues. And we basically look
at how you write code, how you communicate, how you react in the face of 
challenges, how you scope things, things like that. We feel it's a very wholesome
picture that began of the applicant, it is also paid at a flat rate of $25 per 
hour for everyone. It's no indication of, your future pay. But it's the same pay
for every role at, during that trial. The trial should be doable, well, putting in
five to 20 hours per week, I suppose, I think I put in about 10 hours per week, 
which can be a challenge if you're working and maybe have children, we try to 
accommodate as many people as possible.

**Michaela:** [00:09:40] Sounds interesting. So I'm working alongside the team 
that I will probably work with afterwards?

**Leif:** [00:09:46] Well, maybe, maybe. That's not definitely, but you will
work with other Automaticians, or Automattic employees.

**Michaela:** [00:09:57] And then I will do daily tasks that are needed for a 
position actually at that team. Right. So I really do what they would expect 
me to do?

**Leif:** [00:10:05] Yes. And you will write code that if it works out well, 
will probably be used in production.

**Michaela:** [00:10:13] I see. Well, I actually used throw you a little bit in 
the deep end, right. With the whole hiring processes and things like that. And 
that's actually not your role, but I think it's always interesting to see a 
different ways of entering a company.

**Leif:** [00:10:26] Yeah. I agree. And it's one of the, and it's one of the 
interesting, more interesting, parts of the company where it can see how it 
scales. 

**Michaela:** [00:10:34] Yeah. Because it's very different, right? But yeah,
coming back to Software Engineering, at Automattic. So you talked about React
and Nde.js and things like that. What is the tech stack? So if I want to apply
there, or what do you have to bring to the table to be able to work there.

**Leif:** [00:10:53] It depends on the role. Of course, there's different still 
description and the different job postings generally. Um, for code it would 
help if you knew PHP, WordPress, JavaScript, React and yeah, pretty much 
that. But around that, there is always ecosystems of other technologies, 
adjacent technologies that will also be helpful or useful for you, you to know.

Right. So, for example, one project is based on GitHub and it's written in React 
JS. It's a huge app, um, uses Redox as a store and we have proper continuous 
integration there. We have unit tests and integration tests and end to end tests
and whatnot. And then another project, uses, Subversion, and PHP and WordPress, 
and that's pretty much it,that's all the technologies you have available to you. 
So it, it can differ or it can vary a lot. So it helps if you come to it with a 
certain generalist attitude, I think. And if you can learn, then I think you 
already have the most important skill.

**Michaela:** [00:12:22] So what you're saying is also that you're maybe moving 
within the company. So if I let's say I started, on the Git project that you just
mentioned, and then it could be that I'm actually moved or I want to move. I don't
know. What exactly happens to move to a different project.

**Leif:** [00:12:35] So I started out working on the React app, which was very 
interesting with all those new technologies and everything right. Using Git is
always very pleasurable experience, and that is without sarcasm. But at some
point I wanted a change of scenery. I wanted to learn other things that I had
not learned about before. Um, so right now, how that works usually you just send
a private message to Matt and tell him. I am looking to change teams. I'm 
interested in these things. Can you take a look? and then after a couple of days,
he gets back to you and tells you that sure. We might have a position open and 
this team, what do you think? And that's how he started the process of switching
a team internally. So now I work on the marketing team because I thought that being
a developer and knowing something about marketing, that sounds like I'm like a super
power combination, you know? Like, knowing how to market a product that you can 
also build. So right now I'm really in the depth of that, specializing a bit now. 
I'm a project lead for affiliates and partnerships where we basically give people
a commission if they refer customers to us. So that's what I've been doing in. 
the past months, I guess.

**Michaela:** [00:14:03] I really find it an interesting approach that you send 
an email to all the CEOs 

**Leif:** [00:14:08] It's not an email, we don't use email pretty much. So it's
a Slack DM / Slack message.

**Michaela:** [00:14:15] And then he probably asks around for you or talks with 
leadership somewhere else. And you figure out where and how that could be. 

**Leif:** [00:14:23] Exactly. And he also talks to the hiring team because those 
are the people who naturally need to have good understanding of the open roles 
that we need to fill.

**Michaela:** [00:14:32] I guess that this process looks different from other 
companies because you are a fully remote company, right? So you can not bump 
into somebody at the water cooler and tell them, "well, you know, actually I'm a 
little bit interested in changing teams", or something.

**Leif:** [00:14:44] Well, you can do that too. So when you've 
worked on a few teams, you will know a few people around the company who are 
maybe not in your current teams. So you can also use those connections to figure
out where there could be a good match for a new team. 

**Michaela:** [00:15:03] And, but how do you keep contact with those people?
Do you use Slack for that or do you sometimes hang out somewhere in the cyberspace
togther?

**Leif:** [00:15:14] So we use Slack for the more synchronous communication 
needs. Most teams have weekly calls. Most people will have a weekly one on one
call with our lead. And those would usually be a video calls. We do have a, a 
company wide town hall once a month, where Matt basically hosts a huge call and 
talks about what's going on in the company that month. And everyone can join from 
the 900 plus people. Everyone can join that one call and ask questions through 
Slack. It would be, pretty messy, I suppose if everyone was talking and then we
have WordPress, of course we use a specific or a special theme called 'P2' that
we use for project and team blogs. So every team and every project or larger 
projects will have their own blog, where we can post updates, questions, 
specifications, documentation, communications with outside vendors and stuff like
that. And that is pretty much all we use for communicating with each other. We do
not use email at all. 

**Michaela:** [00:16:25] Wow. That's so different to my experience at Microsoft, 
where we are fueled by emails, right? 

**Leif:** [00:16:32] So another big part of how we get to know each other and 
how we build up trust is meeting in person from time to time. So every team meets
about two times per year. And once a year, the whole company meets in one single
place where we have one week of meeting each other, working on projects, learning 
things together and stuff like that. 

**Michaela:** [00:16:53] Yeah, that sounds really good because otherwise you will
have never seen them in person, ever.

**Leif:** [00:16:58] Yeah, and it's also to be honest, it's, um, a big perk of the
company too, that you get to travel like two or three times to interesting places. 

**Michaela:** [00:17:06] Yeah. I always see your Instagram pictures, then, where 
you say like, what was it New Orleans or something was the last time. No?

**Leif:** [00:17:12] Yeah, yeah. 

**Michaela:** [00:17:13] Yeah New Orleans, right? Yeah, wow. It's amazing. I would 
like to be there as well.Yeah. So when you look at it, so your company, is there 
something there's specific going on for the processes and tools that you use for 
an enormous software development? Well, really writing the code, building the code,
deploying the code, testing, something like that. Is this something that you 
think is different from other companies and how does it look like in general?

**Leif:** [00:17:39] I don't know about other companies that much. Um, but I can 
say that because we have a bunch of different products and they are all 
technologically, somewhat different, the approaches we used to: So for 
continuous integration and for version control, for example, they can differ 
like by decades. So WordPress is on some version, right? And we have a WordPress
repository and we need to, to merge with the WordPress core project from time to 
time, or we have to merge the open source project into our repo from time to time,
right? And it also has our own modifications to it. So that project is on Subversion
and there is no GitHub for version, right? The best or the next best thing that 
comes close to that would be Fabricator, which is, kind of like an interface on top
of Subversion repositories, where you can also do things like pull requests and get
reviews on those and stuff like that. And that system itself is also, again, we 
don't use Circle CI or Travis CI or things like that on that repo because those 
systems assume a Git based repository. So we use something that's called Team City
on that. So basically the parts are all the same, theoretically. But in their 
manifestation, they differ. Like they, they will use different technologies. So
we do use version control. We do use code reviews. We do use continuous integration.
We rewrite tests, all those things, but how we do that and how hard it is also will
differ from project to project.

**Michaela:** [00:19:19] Yeah, that's really interesting. I mean, how big is 
Automattic? Can you remind me again?

**Leif:** [00:19:26] The company? That's just 900 people, 

**Michaela:** [00:19:28] 900 hundred people, Okay. And how many engineers do you 
know? 

**Leif:** [00:19:31] It's a rough estimate, I think like, I don't know if 
I recall exactly, but maybe about 400. 

**Michaela:** [00:19:37] Okay. So for 400 people, I think it's quite diverse, 
right? I mean, we are dealing with all those different technologies. You're dealing 
with all those different tools. So also the knowledge that you have to have to 
know all of those really in and out is, Quite scattered, right. Is there 
some future goal of consolidating those different technologies? So like for 
example, porting the WordPress code base to Git or is that too huge a thing to do.

**Leif:** [00:20:06] I think that's politically very heavy subject, because we 
depend on the WordPress open source project. Right. And it's an open source 
project. We don't get to dictate what they use, right. So we have a whole 
team who basically gets paid to work on the open source project, but they are 
trying really hard not to let company decisions or influences, let that 
influence their open source work. So we really. Depend on the open source 
project for that. So if the open source project moves to Git, we can move over too.

**Michaela:** [00:20:43] I see. Okay. Yeah. I never thought about that. I mean, 
that's really an interesting aspect as well of working at Automattic that you 
have like this, I call it now tension a little bit tension between open source 
and the commercial interests of a, of a company, right?

**Leif:** [00:20:57] Yeah. 

**Michaela:** [00:20:58] What are the benefits that the company gets out of open 
sourcing parts of their software. Why do you do that?

**Leif:** [00:21:06] We are an open source company. The company is founded on the idea of 
open source basically, right? So we embrace it and I'm not sure if it's really 
about the concrete advantages of open source, but I think culturally, the spirit 
of openness of transparency, that's helpful in other areas too.

For example, if all the communication is transparent, And if decisions are 
transparent, that creates a vastly different company culture, and that might not 
directly affect code or things like that. But it will affect many other things. 

**Michaela:** [00:21:39] Yeah and actually, I have to say that when I asked you to
be on my podcast, it was quite a quick decision, right? It's just send an email or,
not an email, a message right? To one of your colleagues and they approved it. And
I know that for several other interview  participants, it's like weeks for them to
get well, allowance to even talk. And some of them are just purely denied. It's 
like, no, you cannot talk on a podcast.

**Leif:** [00:22:06] So we have a Slack channel called PR for public relations 
where people talk about things like that. And I just asked the question there 
and by coincidence, the colleague who replied to my question was Matt. Okay. So
I got official okay from the CEO.

**Michaela:** [00:22:26] Oh yeah now I feel really at ease. Now I can ask all 
these tricky questions.

**Leif:** [00:22:32] Yeah, exactly. 

**Michaela:** [00:22:35] Yeah. Very cool. Yeah, that's really something. I mean, 
it's a minor peek into your company, but for me it was very. Well, relieving also.
I asked you to ask for permission, and you asked for permission and within a few 
minutes, you're coming back and saying, yes, I can talk on your podcast. And that's
so nice, right? 

**Leif:** [00:22:52] I mean, we do have some, some back and forth too. We 
don't always have transparency, even if we want it, but the default is 
transparency, openness, low bureaucracy. So, we will never reach the ideal, 
but we're always trying to approximate it. Right? So one guideline that Matt
keeps on mentioning is to quickly make decisions that are easily reversible, 
you know. Like don't, don't fret too much over making a decision that you can
reverse within the matter of minutes anyway. 

**Michaela:** [00:23:27] Yeah, that's really smart. So there's a lot about 
culture, right? How the culture of a company works and well, how long have you 
been now at Automattic? 

**Leif:** [00:23:38] Ooh, I am now, I joined three and a half years ago. 

**Michaela:** [00:23:42] Okay. So do you feel that the culture, I mean, the 
company evolved and grew quite substantially?

**Leif:** [00:23:49] Yes.

**Michaela:** [00:23:51] Did the culture also change much during that time or 
did it stay the same?

**Leif:** [00:23:57] Both. I think so. I think when I joined who we were about 
300 people now we're over 900. So it has tripled in size within three years. It 
would be pretty weird if that would not create friction, I suppose. Especially 
with people coming in who might have worked in other contexts who might be 
further removed from the open source project, for example, they will carry 
a different cultural inventory with them. I believe. So it's a constant balance 
that we're trying to strike between letting more diverse perspectives in, but 
staying true to the core of the company values. One thing that helps with 
that is that we have a creed. The Automattic creed. So if you go to 
Automattic.com/creed, "C R E E D", you will see a short text, which is 
something, "the like the vision for the culture of the company in a nutshell".
And I'm going to read it to you. And the Automattic creed says, 

"I will never stop learning. 
I won't just work on things that are assigned to me. 
I know there's no such thing as a status quo. 
I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. 
I will never pass up opportunity to help a colleague,
and I will remember the days before I knew everything. 
I am more motivated by impact than money, 
and I know that open source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. 
I will communicate as much as possible because it's the 
oxygen of a distributed company. 
I'm in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, 
the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day.
Given time, there is no problem that's insurmountable" 

and that's the Automattic creed. And that is basically the, the gospel that we
try to reference when we need to make decisions that we're not sure whether they
align with company goals, company, culture, or values and things like that. And 
usually it at least gives us a rough direction to turn to. 

**Michaela:** [00:26:12] Yeah, I liked it. I liked it a lot. It sounds like a 
person spent a lot of time really thinking about the values of the company.
Yeah, that's nice. So I wanted to switch gears a little bit now and talk with 
you about the software engineering processes. So do you have similar guidelines, 
like the Automattic Creed for your development processes, and how do you do 
things? Like, for example, how do you test your system? 

**Leif:** [00:26:38] So non end to end tests, all the tests that don't need a
browser to run, I would say the developers to write themselves as part of their
ongoing work, but for end to end tests where we use like a handle as browser to
actually use the site and buy things and sign up for that, we do have a specific
team who works on that, just because it's a very specific niche technology and you
have to develop a very deep expertise to be able to automate all that and to know
how to handle issues. For example, if you try to buy something and the test fails,
why is that? Is that because maybe the payments provider was down or is it a 
problem in your code? And if you have many dependencies to other services, then it
can become pretty hairy pretty quickly. So it's nice to have a specific team for that.

**Michaela:** [00:27:36] Okay. And do you have like something like code coverage?
Do you track that? Is this something that's part of your daily basis or not?

**Leif:** [00:27:42]  No, I don't think we do that. I think we did discuss 
measuring something like code coverage at some point, but then I think we 
didn't want to focus too much on a single metric. So we did experiment around 
that a bit. And I think what we ended up with is a integration on GitHub that 
posts a message to your PR. If the code that you add has code coverage lower 
than something, something like that. Something not too obnoxious, something kind 
of subtle. 

**Michaela:** [00:28:20] And now that you said, well, the whole landscape is 
very diverse technology wise, but also tool-wise. Is, is that also something
that's different for each of the teams and projects that you work on? Or is
there some standard policy around testing, code reviews, things like that? 

**Leif:** [00:28:37] We don't have a standard policy written out anywhere, I 
think. We do have guidelines in, so we do have a company handbook, So to say.
It's called the field guide. It's just another blog. Everyone can edit it and
you can find out pretty much anything you need to know about working here by
looking into it. And it does have a few guidelines for how to, how to test the
projects, um, how much effort to put into it. So you don't get derailed, but it's
no, there's no hard written rules, I would say. So usually you would. Look at the
product that you're working on and figure out what the testing culture is on that
product. And then basically blend in, be normal right.

**Michaela:** [00:29:24] Okay. But it can differ from project to project.

**Leif:** [00:29:28] Yeah. Especially because it's just different, very different
technologies. Right. 

**Michaela:** [00:29:33] Okay. So it's sort of technology driven, alignments. 

**Leif:** [00:29:38] Technology influenced, I would say, yeah. And also, um, I 
mean, yeah, different products are obviously of different importance, right? So 
that will play into that as well. I would say so Wordpress.com has, I don't, I 
don't know if I can say the number, but it has lots of users and it would be a 
really bad if it would break. So that would have different standards than say an
internal app that we're developing for just for comfort reasons.

**Michaela:** [00:30:08] Yeah, that makes sense. And what about code reviews? 
So, one of my topics that I worked a lot on was code reviews and how they 
are used to improve the code quality, but also to share knowledge amongst 
developers is, is contribute something that you do at Automattics and how are 
people perceiving it?

**Leif:** [00:30:27] I think it's changed over time. So when I joined, there was 
still a few people who would just cowboy code and commit, but that is getting 
fewer and fewer. It's been. Probably two years or something like that since I've 
seen anyone commit without a review. So every pull request or whatever you may 
call it, every change will have been looked at by at least one other colleague.
If it's very sensitive stuff, like for example, payments code, then we would have
two or three other colleagues look at it, depending on at what level we would feel
comfortable. Right. We'd also reach out to experts on the subject matter if we are
not experts ourselves. So that's yeah, I think that's really nice how it works. I
feel very happy with having everything reviewed.

**Michaela:** [00:31:16] Mhm, this gives you a good feeling about your own code and 
about the code from others?

**Leif:** [00:31:20] Yeah, generally I think it makes for a good environment 
where we all know about our own fallibility. Like, we all know that "this is an 
obvious fix" were famous last words. Right? Like it's very hard if you work on 
something to really, really, really be sure that this doesn't break anything because
you don't know everything. Right. And again, going back to The Creed, "I remember
the days before I knew everything". So this sort of humility is kind of built in
into the company culture. So most people are very thankful for, for others, um, to
look at their code.

**Michaela:** [00:31:57] Yeah, that sounds great. Especially for code 
reviews, one of the pitfalls or problems with it is that you wait very long for 
other people to look at your code. And I can imagine that the distributed 
company, while remote and distributed company with different time zones, that 
can be painful. How do you mitigate that? 

**Leif:** [00:32:17] So many teams use, um, Trello. To basically move cards 
through backlog, this week, in progress, in review, and done. Something like that. 
And those changes will be posted to the team's Slack channels. So if I see a 
colleague move something into a review column on Slack, then I'll know this is 
ready for review.

I will usually not get to it immediately. But if it's, it has some time pressure 
behind it, then the colleague will reach out to me and ask me, Hey, do you have 
a minute today to take a look at this? I really like to deploy this today 
because that would really benefit our customers in X and Y. But there are also 
of course, reviews that are neither important nor urgent, but we still are one to 
review that code.

So we do have a, it's a Slack app. We call it the stick and the 
stick. So I think it comes from being beaten with a stick. So it's like, it's 
a nudge, you know, it nudges you, to review. So it has like a config file where it 
can set up your teams and those teams Trello boards. So it continuously, 
or once a day, it looks at your teams Trello board looks at all the cards that
are in the in review column, and then randomly pings people on Slack "Hey, Leif, 
what about reviewing this one today?". So you get actual pings on Slack by the 
stick and depending on the person, I think very few people ignore it because a 
ping on Slack is kind of like, it's a thing you kind of should be doing okay. 
Yeah. And that really helps keep that "needs review" column clean. 

**Michaela:** [00:34:12] Okay. So one thing that I wanted to ask you as well is, 
well, if you have this, do you have this review staff, but then how far are 
actual developers away from production. What I mean by that is, well, imagine 
you're making a new feature or back fix or whatever, what steps are in between 
you saying, well, my code is done and having it in production, how much steps 
are in between which steps and maybe a roughly estimate of a time, if you can 
give it.

**Leif:** [00:34:42] So again, the specifics will depend on the project that 
you're working on because of the different technologies. But roughly if you have 
something that has been reviewed. So you're confident that a sufficient 
number of reviewers have told you that this can be deployed, then you merge it 
and you deploy it. We have a command to deploy the latest master branch, basically,
to production. And that's it. 

**Michaela:** [00:35:10] Okay. So you're quite quickly there and that's then 
really in production, is there some staging happening before, or?

**Leif:** [00:35:17] We do have a staging for at least one of the projects where 
we can try things out with the proper host names and everything, and with actual 
production data, but that's like only a last check. So you would spend maybe 10 
minutes clicking around a bit there to see if really everything's really, really,
really all right. But usually our development environments and our testing 
environments are close enough to production for us to be relatively sure that 
things will work the same.

**Michaela:** [00:35:51] And what about these testers that you said all of those 
tests are automatic tests that really end to end test, and those you would run 
before deploying to production as well? 

**Leif:** [00:36:02] Yeah, they could run automatically for every pull request. 
So if you create a pull request that has a label "needs review", then that will 
automatically run all the end to end tests on it.

**Michaela:** [00:36:13] Cool, and what about technical debt? I mean, that's. A 
topic that's discussed hotly and it's a very fuzzy term as well, but I would like
to talk with you about it, but role has technical debt in Automattic and how do
you handle it? How do you assess it on a day to day? 

**Leif:** [00:36:30] Right. I mean, we definitely do have technical debt.
There's no way around that. Mostly because we try to move fast and we try to
work only on the things that we really want to accomplish. And, that can be a
aspect where, for example, future maintainability, can become more difficult 
because you're trying to optimize for shipping customer value. Right? 

Once a quarter, we do have a week where basically every developer works on things
like that. Either technical debt or also things like UX debt, like where where 
flows don't match with each other, but it's not a priority for any team. So it 
kind of lingers in there. But once a quarter, we have this week where we address
things like that. And over, over the weeks we collect tasks that we think would
be a good idea for such a week. And during the week, we will then have like a pile
of tech debt or UX debt tasks that we can work on. Actually, we are in such a work. 
In, in such a week right now.

**Michaela:** [00:37:42] So then that's your main focus or your sole focus?

**Leif:** [00:37:45] Yeah, pretty much the sole focus. I mean, the lights need
to be kept on, obviously. So you cannot 100% focus on that. Um, usually, but it's
a large part of my day. If I'm not on a podcast, um, then I would usually try to
work on those tasks. When the whole company tries to address tech debt and UX debt
once a quarter for a whole week. That means you get a nice cadence into it. You get
into a rhythm where things, things aren't perfect at any one time, but they 
continuously get better step-by-step you know? And I think that's how we try to 
address it. And then we can refactor things while we work on it. Right. So we try 
to build that kind of maintenance into our daily work also. But, um, it's not our 
sole focus, right? Like we, we try to optimize for shipping customer value. 

**Michaela:** [00:38:48] Yeah. Yeah. I like the really scheduled and planned 
approach as well because otherwise people tend to work on things that are just 
more impactful or they you know, like to work on shipping feature. They somehow 
always feels probably more urgent or more fun as well. So it's sort of bookkeeping,
right? So when tax season ends, you somehow have to do your taxes. Right. So if 
there wouldn't be a deadline, probably nobody would do that.

**Leif:** [00:39:15] Yeah. Or documentation. I recently saw a talk 
where she discussed the incentives around writing documentation, and she said 
that nobody ever got fired for not writing documentation, and nobody ever got 
promoted for writing documentation, which is probably roughly true.
So what incentive is there to do these things, right? But if you see the whole 
company turn towards this one goal for a whole week, then again, You want to 
behave as most people do. So, okay. Let's look at tech debt this week. 

**Michaela:** [00:39:48] Yeah. True. I'd also like that pick up the topic
about promotion. So how, how do you think you're assessed? How is, is there
a form of process for, is, do you know how people assess you? What they look
for? How'd you get promoted? What's the life there that Automattic. 

**Leif:** [00:40:04] Hmm. So what's the promotion, So when you like a change in 
title? or the change in the responsibility?

**Michaela:** [00:40:14] Yeah good question, maybe I don't know. Very often I 
think it's a change in title, better compensation for what you do. 

**Leif:** [00:40:23] So, so a compensation is reviewed once a year automatically,
you don't have to do anything. And basically it takes into account the work you
did the year before, and depending on how impactful you were on how much value
you shipped to customers, basically your salary will get adjusted, by more or by
less. You'll never get a reduction. You'll always get a slight increase just to 
account for inflation, but that's all there is to compensation and Automattic. 

**Michaela:** [00:40:54] But how would you assess the quality that you shipped or 
the value that you ship to customers? I mean, that's not that easy to measure I 
imagine.

**Leif:** [00:41:01] Sure. Um, so regularly your team lead will get a request for
feedback and they will like try to document everything that you saw about your
report and report that in that request for feedback and the employee themselves
will also get such a feedback request for self feedback, and they can also give
feedback on their lead. So, and it can be anonymous if you want to, you can decide
to share that feedback with a person, but you don't have to.

And that's how we get a constant stream of feedback about people, but on the 
formal side and on the career track side, we don't have any titles. Really. We 
can choose our own titles. Let me quickly look that up. Matt Mullenweg with, I 
looked that up in the employee directory, his title is "C-BBQ-TT", which stands 
for Chief Barbeque Taste Tester, I think - something like that. So it can be very
random, can be fun, but it can also be a matter of fact. So some people will say
senior developer and that's what they are. So roll or responsibility, isn't tied 
closely to compensation. So if you become a team lead that we try to not consider 
that a promotion, there will be no change in compensation if you change your role.

The incentives are designed in a way to optimize for people who really want to do
the things that the role requires. So if you become a lead and your salary doesn't 
change, it's suddenly much easier. Just say, wait, "Yeah, this is really annoying. 
Like I've given this a shot for a year" and actually, I like writing code better
and there will be no change in compensation, so you can do that. So, and that way
we try to keep the people in the lead roles, in the management roles who really like
the management work right. At a traditional company, you would, I don't know, get
like pay bump once you're a, like a manager and then you adjust to the new lifestyle
and you can't go back and suddenly you're stuck with this role and that's something
we try to guard against. 

**Michaela:** [00:43:29] Okay. Yeah. I see that. And so you said at the 
beginning, you said that you're striving for a lot of transparency and things 
like that. Is that also reflected, for example, in the, I mean, especially if 
you don't have those titles, I think on one hand, it's really good because it 
takes away though on the other hand, it's a little bit less transparent, right? 

**Leif:** [00:43:51] It's definitely a double edged sword. I mean, also just 
people coming in and it's not something that'd be advertised warning: We have 
no career titles here. Right. And that's something you definitely have to grow 
into. But to me it was, it is somewhat freeing, you know where to realize that
you don't have to follow this career ladder that someone somewhere designed at
some point, but that, and basically make your own adventure right. And grow in 
ways that you think are interesting for you at this moment in time, it is a huge 
adjustment, but if you're still here or if you're still at Automattic after two 
years, you will probably have adjusted to this way. And, if not, then you might
think about leaving because I don't know, you crave external career progression 
more, titles more, maybe you're a very title oriented per person, then that would 
maybe not be a good fit because everyone should choose the random title. 

**Michaela:** [00:44:50] Yeah, I can see how that fits into the Automattic 
culture and the idea of being humble. Well, one thing that I wanted to talk with
you about, and that I think fits a little bit into that topic as well is, diversity.
How diverse is, especially the technical workforce, at Automattic. 

**Leif:** [00:45:09] Um, so the tech industry in general is basically white 
dudes, right? And we are mostly that too. It's something we are trying to 
actively address by being more present at, at events where a much more diverse 
audience might be present. We try to reach out proactively a bit more. We try to
make ourselves available. We try to remove our own biases when hiring by for example,
When we decided to hire a person, we have not have had a video chat with them. So 
you can go through the whole process before anyone sees your face. For example, we 
also do have an internal diversity and inclusion committee that meets regularly 
and tries to take care of where the whole company is headed regards to that, but
it's not solved, right? Like it's very, obviously still a problem. And that's the
case for us too. We're all very aware of it. And for example, the developer hiring
is 50% or more than 50% females. And that that is really nice, you know, like, so 
the people who can make the decisions, the people who will impact what kind of 
people will join. They're already, at about 50% I believe. And I think that's a 
pretty good sign to have, like, they're kind of like the gatekeepers, right. 
Even though they try to be impartial and reduce their own biases. They, they are
the gatekeepers. And it's nice to know that there is a, a larger number of 
perspectives on that team than there has been traditionally.

**Michaela:** [00:46:50] So, yeah, I can really see how that can impact the 
hiring decisions, and I think it's a really good step forward. 

I wanted to thank you Leif, for this awesome interview. It was, I think, very well
rounded. We covered a lot of topics. What do you think?

**Leif:** [00:47:04] My pleaseure. Yeah I think so, very nice.

**Michaela:** [00:47:05] So thank you for being on my show and letting me know 
so much about your work life at Automattic. 

**Leif:** [00:47:11] Yes. Thanks for having me.


**Michaela:** [00:47:14] Thank you Leif talk soon. Bye bye.
