[00:00:00] **Michaela:** Hello, and welcome back. After the quite extensive 
summer break. This felt so good, to the software engineering unlocked podcast. I'm
your host, Dr. McKayla. And today I have the pleasure to talk to Karl Hughes. 
But before I start, I want to let you know of the new and upcoming code review
workshops where you can purchase individual tickets. This workshops are great for
people who don't want to organise a workshop for the whole team, or who want to
learn together developers with from different companies all around the world. My next
workshop will start again at the end of September. To find out more, please go
to awesomecodereviews.com. I will also link it to the show notes, but now back
to Karl. Karl is the software engineer who turned it entrepreneur in the midst
of the pandemic last year, his startup draft.dev creates content that reaches
software engineers, which means that he combined his two passions development
and content creation. Today, I will ask him all about his new business and what
he ambitions and what he wants to reach. So Karl, welcome to the show. 

[00:01:27] **Karl:** Thanks for having me Michaela. 

[00:01:30] **Michaela:** So maybe I introduced you a lot with this new startup,
but actually what I want to start off with is the startup or the side project
that I know you from, and that is CFP land, Call For Paper land. How do you 
pronounce it though? 

[00:01:45] **Karl:** Yeah, I say CFP land for short, but CFP stands for Call 
For Papers or Call For Proposals depending on who you ask. 

[00:01:53] **Michaela:** Exactly. So it's, it's a sideways. I find all the
relevant tech conferences. Right? And then know where to submit it, how to
submit.

And so I think from that, I know actually your activities a little bit. And so,
how is that going? Like it had to been really hard for the pandemic and
everything. No conferences?

[00:02:13] **Karl:** Yeah, it's been a weird year and a half for CFP land. So I
started the kind of backstory on that. I started speaking at conferences a few
years ago and just for fun and to kind of get out there and meet more people and
learn things. And so it was great. I had a lot of fun, met a lot of people, but
one of the challenges, a lot of the speakers we would always talk about it. 
It's like, where do we find all the CFPs that are available when they close? 
Like where do we apply? What kind of speakers they looking for? Things like 
that. And so I started off CFE land, it's just a simple newsletter, just running
it. You know, it was very much a side project and eventually it grew. And it's
now a website with a newsletter. It's well over 2000 people subscribed to it. 
So it's a pretty popular. I mean, this is a small world of tech conference 
speakers, but it's pretty popular within that small world. So a lot of people
do hear my name from it, but it's always been just a thing to do on the side. 
Actually, the beginning of last year, right before the pandemic happened, I was
thinking about, starting a business. Maybe I would make CFE land or something 
like it, a full-time thing, which was fortunately, I didn't go all in on that 
site because it was really, I mean, it went from, you know, we were getting 
consistently growing traffic to all of a sudden, just almost to zero overnight 
and yeah. I mean, its one of those things I'm glad it was just a hobby project.
It's starting to come back. Now. Things are starting to, you know, conferences
are starting to like look at coming in person. And also just the virtual events
are starting to get more predictable. People are figuring out how to work them.
So all of it I think is going to come back and it's going to be, you know, I'll
put more effort into it this year. But it's been a tough year for the project
and for anybody who's into event marketing and speaking.


[00:03:42] **Michaela:** Yeah, I can imagine. I mean I started off with on-site
trainings and it wasn't like good start _(laugh)_ March, like grew up. So. Why 
do you change from like you were employed before, right? You were a software 
engineer, you were a manager. So how did you change from that to become your 
own boss? So why during the pandemic, was that something that you did deliberately
or something that, you know, just the events happened and this is how it go?

[00:04:16] **Karl:** Yeah, that's a good question. So, I've been with startups.
Uh, I've always worked in startups, tech startups, like small companies, less
than a hundred people. And so I started off just as a software engineer and was
then most recently like leading a team of engineers. And I really enjoyed it. I
actually liked my company a lot, but unfortunately the business was pretty
strongly affected negatively by the pandemic.And so myself and the rest engineers
went down to half-time to kind of conserve money and make sure the company could
get through it and figure out what we're going to do next. And so in that 
half-time I started to explore, well, what do I want to do? Maybe I'll do 
something different next, maybe I'll try a career shift. So I started writing 
for fun on the side, just kind of called up some people I knew and started writing
technical blog posts for them. And then I found some lists of places you could 
write technical blog posts. And I realized there's a lot of people who want 
engineers who were willing to write some blog posts on the side, and I figured
it was a good mix of my skills and it also was not negatively affected by the
pandemic, like speaking was and things like that. So I started doing it and I
realized quickly that there was a lot of companies that wanted this kind of
content and that I could work with other engineers to sort of increase my output.
draft.dev was kind of born out of just seeing so many people ask me, 'Hey, could
you write for us?' And I just realized I only had so many hours, so I better start
bringing some other people in on this. So yeah, that it was really, I needed 
something to do on the side. And then eventually it became a full-time thing 
within three or four months. I think I had transitioned out of my old job and 
was doing draft.dev full-time with a very small team at first. 

[00:05:46] **Michaela:** And so right now, are you still writing content? Are
you mainly managing people that write for you? 

[00:05:52] **Karl:** Yeah, mostly managing now. So it grew pretty quickly this
year. I think it's about quadrupled in size from what it was in January, which
is, feels surreal. So I'm almost exclusively managing hiring and kind of helping
other people get unstuck. I still do a lot of sales calls as well, but the bulk
of our work is done by software engineers who want to write blog posts around 
the world. And so for them, it's a nice little nice and weekends thing they can
do. They make some extra money and they get to learn new technology and write
about it. Show what they know for our clients. They're getting experts who are
interested in their tools and their tech that they work in. 

[00:06:29] **Michaela:** Yeah. Cool. That's really cool. So how do you make the
match between the people that you know, write and the eople that want things
written? 

[00:06:39] **Karl:** We've got kind of a word it's still an evolving process for
sure. We do some recruits. Of writers that are in specific skillsets when need 
be. And then we put all of our writers into a list, and if you're on our writer
list, you get an email every couple of weeks. That's kind of like, here's all 
the open opportunities for writing. And we have people sort of like give us,
just basically apply to write for each of them. And we ended up trying to match
up the best writers with the topics because, you know, a client might want an 
article done in PHP and JavaScript and Ruby and you know, something else instead
of like, we've got to find like a mix of writers to cover all those, which is,
can be really tricky. But our, our pool of writers now is I think 50 or 60 
active writers. And so it makes it easier once you've got a pretty good volume 
of writers to help pick up the assignments. 

[00:07:28] **Michaela:** Okay. And do you vet them somehow? Do you look at the
plagarism and if they can right or that, I mean, there's also like a reason out 
there. Right? So people just call from the side.

[00:07:40] **Karl:** It's a huge, that's a huge undertaking. I mean, this is why
this is why clients like working with us because it is a lot of work to try to
find and vet good engineers who are also good writers.

So we do have a process. We start with a rubric, a skills rubric, but one thing
that I learned as an engineering manager was it's really helpful to hire people
based on objective criteria, as much as possible. That's not, you know, there's
always a little bit of fuzziness when you're working with humans, but like we
try to have like a pretty objective rubric that allows us to.

Great or rate each applicant based on specific criteria around like, how good
did they do at writing? How good are they do explaining deep technical topics?
How good were they at? Uh, things like communication and answering emails
promptly, just, you know, being in touch. Uh, and then we evaluate each
candidate and we'll accept or ask for more samples from each one.

So we do ask for existing published samples or sort of written sample of their
work. You know, most of the engineers who we write with are pretty experienced 
as far as writers and engineers. Because we are a lot of the topics that we 
cover are kind of hard to cover, uh, sort of things that most junior developers
would have a hard time maybe picking up on the first try.

[00:08:53] **Michaela:** Yeah. So maybe one thing that comes to my mind.
I'm also like a entrepreneur and I'm doing mostly workshops and cultural
workshops. I'm also doing consultancy right now. I'm doing quite a bit of
research again. And so that's exciting, but on the other hand, but I'm
always feeling like I always have this urge I have to program again. Right. 
So I'm not constantly programming because while that's not my job right now, 
but if I'm like, months or you know still figured out(??), something. I feel 
like, oh my God, I'm losing touch. And I really want to go back into it and 
I'm coding something on the side and I'm always like, I'm still struggling with
how to, you know, make that a habit that it's always constantly there because I
feel it's so important. I mean, especially for me, but I think also if you are 
a dev shop(??) for writers, I think it's important to stay at dev somehow. I 
don't know. How, how is that for you? I think it's also the same for managing, 
right? If you're in a managerial role and you're managing people, how far can 
like a CTO or a engineering manager? How far can they be away from actually
doing the stuff? Right. I think it's so important. I spent a lot of time, the
last couple of weeks, really getting, knowing everything about the latest code
review tools that are out there and, you know, all the studying and analysis 
again. And you have to do that, I think periodically because otherwise you 
really lose touch. How do you think about that and how do you combine that with
what you do right now?

[00:10:32] **Karl:** Yeah, I agree. I think that there's a lot of value in
staying in touch with the technical skills. Even if you like, I've always
admitted to my employees and myself, I'm not the best engineer who's ever
written code. Right. Like that's okay with me. It's okay. Really love working 
with people who are good because they are way better because then you get to
see sort of like, oh man, humbling experiences. Right. And reminds you. But I
do think it's important for engineering managers, CTOs, who are at least at 
smaller companies, CTOs to stay at least somewhat connected to what's going on
the ground. So the way I do that, A couple of things. First I do occasionally
for fun, write my own technical articles. So I do it for say like guest posting
on different blogs or maybe on my own personal site or other sites around that
people ask me to write for. So I do that some just to keep up with what's going
on. I think I did pick up like a client article a couple of weeks ago because I
thought it was an interesting topic and I wanted to get my feet wet in it. And
then the other thing is what I find is that it is easier to pick up new tech 
when you've already picked up several things along your career. So unlike when
you're first learning to code, you know, a lot of junior engineers always ask
like, well, how do you, how do you just pick up a new language so quickly? I'm
like, well, when you've learned four or five, the sixth is not that much harder
because a lot of the same paradigms, the same concepts apply.
The same is true. If they. When you've used six different web hosts in your
career, likely the seventh one is not that much different so that you probably
don't have to learn everything from scratch. Same like any CI/CD tools, testing
tools, whatever. Like yes, there is some difference and yes there's subtle
things that are important to know the differences between. But like, you don't
have to always be the, you know, you don't have to know everything from the root
level. You just kind of have to get a good high-level sense of how is this 
different from the other things I've done in the past that are similar. 

[00:12:17] **Michaela:** Yeah, that's true. I mean, as I said, I was looking at
study analysis tools recently and obviously it's different. Right. It's different
because it's more integrated in DevOps, for example, in CI/CD, right? It's a 
little bit more automated, but in the end it was the same, _(laugh)_ like the
same as 10 years ago. Right. So, I totally, and the same, like for languages. 
I feel that picking up, and this is something that I really, I mean, I love to
talk about it because I feel like you can pick it up quite fast, but then really 
getting really good at it. It's even, I think sometimes a little bit harder if
you have a lot of baggage, right? So like coming from the object oriented Java
and C-sharp world. And I recently it's not recent anymore, but like two and a 
half years ago I started with python. And I mean, obviously I could program and
I could, could really productively do stuff within really short amount of time.
I mean, it was days that I, you know. But then I feel like stuck and I feel
like, oh, it really took me quite some time to understand, you know, and feel
comfortable really that I know how to architecture in python. I could
architecture, but it was like it was a Java or a C# application but Python(??).
Which didn't feel like it's not by tonic(??) and it's not like how you would do 
it in that language and learning that and changing the mental models that you
already have. I found that quite, quite interesting and tricky. How has that 
for you? 

[00:13:47] **Karl:** I agree. I, that is tricky. I think one thing that I've
thought about in this transition from being like engineering leader, who's
expected to still really know the tech to more of a business owner is that I
don't necessarily have to be the best at those lower level of knowledge, right?
The specific implementation details. I may not always be the best, but at a high
level, I shouldn't how does Python work versus Java? Like I should know that 
it's almost like knowing what you don't know is good. So knowing that I'm not 
going to write Pythonic at code, like you call it is maybe helpful more than
just knowing like exactly the best way to write Python, because you can always,
when you're, again, kind of going back, putting my business owner hat, My goal
is to make the company run well. So that might mean hiring somebody who knows
these things better than me. It might mean hiring technical reviewers in the
future. As I get less connected to the day to day, it might mean hiring well, 
we already do this. We hire a lot of writers who are experienced in languages 
and frameworks that I really haven't used much if at all. So yeah, it's 
definitely important to like, know where your limits are and then be like, 
ask yourself the question of, you know, is this the best thing for me to learn 
myself? Or can I hire someone? To who knows it already and get even more 
bandwidth out of this. 

[00:15:00] **Michaela:** Yeah, I like that mindset. I mean, in general, maybe
that's what I want to deep dive a little bit with you. Is that mindset of the 
manager, a CTO or also a business owner? I think I'm still struggling with that.
I like two years ago with this was like I totally didn't feel like it. And so 
even though I started already my business, I would never say to myself, I'm the 
founder or, you know, business owners thing. I always say like, I'm a software 
engineer. _(laugh)_ Like, and, and it really took me one and a half years to 
say, okay, I feel a little bit comfortable. You know, I'm doing now my tax and
all of that, but I still struggle with, for example, sales. Right. It's just 
something that I feel, I dunno, like, and, but you were talking about sales, 
like I'm doing sales calls and all of that. So how do you get into that mindset
of actually doing the stuff that a business owner does versus, you know, doing
the stuff that an engineer does? 

[00:15:59] **Karl:** Yeah. I mean, there's nothing, so I'll just like play the
other side and say there's nothing wrong with becoming a business owner
consultant who stays very much a software engineer let's say. You know, I have 
several friends who are consultants or freelancers that essentially like they 
have a very flexible, interesting work where they can do, you know, work for 
several different clients, but they don't really have a bunch of employees there.
It's kind of just them being a freelancer. And that's fine. There's nothing 
wrong with that. But if you sort of. If your goal is to build a company that 
runs either without you, or it runs with you being able to take a vacation, 
things like that, then you kind of have to step out and figure out what it 
means to be a business owner and a team leader rather than a doer. You know, 
the person who's touching every piece of content or whatever. So it just depends
your goals, right? Like there's nothing wrong with either path. My goal went in
starting draft was, I mean, it was initially just like figure out if this was 
like something I wanted to do. And then I realized, yeah, it's something I want
to do. There's a lot of people who want it. So I kind of, my long-term dream has
always kind of been to start my own company and run it. And so this has just been
like a really good opportunity at the right time and place, but it is hard. And 
one other thing that's really hard about it. Letting things go to other people 
when you know, you could do it better yourself.
And I still struggle with that. I mean, like there's some articles that come
through and I read what the writer wrote and I'm like, yeah, it's not bad,
but you know, I know I would do this better this differently or whatever it is.
It's so hard to let that stuff go. And I don't know what the answer is.
If you get yourself booked so solid that you can't possibly do it all yourself,
that will force you to get good at delegating or you'll just fail. So that's one
way you can do it too. 

[00:17:56] **Michaela:** Yeah. True. I think I'm like right now, I'm
also in a place in my business that I'm thinking. What are my next steps, right?
So I grew to a capacity level where I just can't, like, I'm saying no to a lot
of things, but I'm not set up in a way that I can take that on and delegate.
Right. And, and I, and I know maybe it's also mindset again, it's not only
mindset. It's also like, if you're already at capacity, how do you get a person?
And how do you know, you know, like how do you get them to the point that they
could actually take off and do stuff. Right. So even for the podcast, I actually
have like, And little advertisement out there that, you know, I want somebody
that helps me with the podcast. I haven't found anybody yet, so yeah, I'm really
admiring that you say, well, you have like a couple of full-time engineers,
right.

That are writing for you. And then like these large network of people that
[00:18:00] are working with you a little bit more in a loosely coupled way and
was just in a couple of months. Right. So how did you get the first ones?

[00:18:49] **Karl:** Yeah. So this is my process for this. I'm a huge nerd for
process. So like it's excessive at times, but I'll just like, be bare it all 
out here.

What I do is I track my time. So I'm pretty diligent about that. And that tells
me like, am I spending say eight hours or 20 hours a week writing articles. So
at some point I reached a critical mass where I was writing. 20 or 30 hours a
week. And I realized, okay, if I want to spend 10 to 20 hours a week on sales
and marketing, I cannot keep writing.

I have to stop and pull this out. So I started to look for other writers. And so
that was my first step. What I first did to, to hire the very first one was
looked into my network and people I trusted already. So I was like to think of
the first hire for any position is kind of your trailblazer is how I call what I
call them.

And that means. You're going to give them very imperfect information, but you
need them to be smart enough or have worked with you enough to have a high level
of trust with you. Like, you know, this kind of goes back to your point about
the podcast person. You do want to be picky in that very first hire because
they're going to help you set forth a process, then you'll be able to imprint
onto other people in the future.

So that very first writer, Was a friend of mine who I knew could write well, he
had a similar background in writing engineering and we were in the same city. 
So we could talk if we need to did a great job, he helped me figure out what 
things are clear and not clear when I pass work over to a writer from a client.
So that was my first step. And then the next thing is to build like a template
for what this work looks like in the future. And me and him just kind of like
trial and error basically figured out what, what worked and what, didn't, what I
needed to give him, to make him. All the information you needed to write articles.
And then we start, I started to test it out with other people. So I found people
outside of my network, who slightly, I didn't know, quite as well or didn't
trust quite as much, or didn't have as much experience. I just started to try
them out and see what happened. And then that helped me refine the process even 
further. And so by December of last year, I was starting to ramp down on my 
writing and ramp up with these other writers. I found a new bottleneck and that
new bottleneck was, I was spending a lot of time editing and editing was also very
tedious detail oriented work that I tend not to be the best at or the, like, it
doesn't, it doesn't get me excited it just drains me. And so I started looking 
for an editor and I kind of did the same thing. I started with someone, I knew 
someone I trusted and I pay them really well. And I was like, look, I don't know
how to edit, but you've done it professionally for years. Could you edit this 
article? And like, help me come up with a process and style guide. And she's now
our managing editor and she's full-time and she has a couple other editors she
works with now or under her. So I kind of followed this exact same process every 
time I want to make a hire, just do that account manager. I'd done like a 
marketing person. And it is hard. It is definitely something that you're going 
to like, you have to be okay with that person, screwing some things up. You 
can't expect them to pull everything out of your head, but if they free you up
to say, spend more time on the growth side of the business, the sales, marketing, 
the stuff that generates new business and keeps clients really happy. And coming 
back then it's worth those slight hiccups that are going to happen because 
that's the only way you kind of get a bigger company together.

[00:22:04] **Michaela:** Yeah, that's true. Yeah. But you know, the funny thing
is that, you know what I did, I started to automate._(laugh)_

[00:22:13] **Karl:** Well, that's not bad. I think that's a really viable
option if you, I mean, this honestly, like hiring people should be like your
second resort. Like the first resort should be automating everything as much as
possible.

[00:22:28] **Michaela:** Yeah. That's what I tried to do. I honestly, when I looked
into that, I thought that couple of things you can really automate very well and
they're nice tools around and a couple of things were still really imperfect,
right? So like the editing for the podcast. For example, even though I upgraded
my tools and my process. I actually have is a step-by-step guide, how to do that. 
Right. But the automation is not completely, like, you cannot really automate that
too much. There's so much manual, still manual thing. But for example, the whole
booking guests and things like this, there is a lot of potential for automation
that you can actually do before hiring somebody. Maybe another topic that I want
to pick your brain on is, well, when you hire, right. Do you have also to think 
about how much of the money that you get from your business, right? Are you 
investing in the hires again? Right? Which for me is also a little bit tricky to 
do. I mean, especially podcasts, it's not really making money. Right. So it's 
also harder then to say, well, you know, like you're hiring people, but how has
that for you? Would you say that at that point it's okay if the company's had 
a loss or does it have to be, you know, positive or neutral or, you know, what 
is your thinking about how much do you spend for hiring and growth and how much 
does the business have to, you know, sustain itself as a bootstrap business?
Right. So funded business. Yeah?

[00:23:54] **Karl:** it definitely, this definitely depends on the kind of
company you have and the way that cashflow works and the way that if you've
raised money, it's a different thing than if you're bootstrapping or
self-funding. And so I've seen it done both ways. Like when I've worked at
funded startups, the way they did it is, you know, we raise a big chunk of money
and that sits in the bank essentially.And then we start to hire ahead of where, 
like basically you hire for what you want to be at in a year. So we bring on 
five or 10 people all really quickly. And then we try to like get to the point 
where we can actually support them. So that's risky obviously. And if you're 
you're bootstrapping, that's not really an option. I didn't have hundreds 
of thousands of dollars sitting in the bank to just work from. Right. So, 
the way that I did it was sort of when I started draft, I started to think 
about. Okay. I don't have a lot of money. How could I build a business? 
Basically, clients helped me pay for these things. So what we do is we, we 
get clients pay upfront and that helps us know we've got the cash in hand to 
pay the writers, editors, and anyone else supporting staff that we need over 
the three or six months of execution. So it's like, we kind of make the plan 
with the client up front and then they pay us and then we actually get into 
production and then we start paying people, but the client's already paid us 
a large portion upfront, or they've been on a payment plan or whatever. So that
helps a ton with being able to know that what we're doing is profitable. The 
other thing that I do is a forecasting. So basically looking at how much, it 
costs us to produce an article, how much we can have to charge for that. And
then where's the like margin, you know, the profit essentially, but in how much
that margin goes to other things like support staff, other support staff that
isn't really counted there, or services or tools. To your point about automation 
I'm big on that too. I spend a lot on SAAS tools that automate a lot of these
little things behind the scenes. Yeah. So Zapier and even Calendly and having
all that stuff, just kind of automatically do this little administrative work is
really, really helpful. And I think it does allow you to run a lot leaner
business even if you pay all the subscription fees, it's still cheaper than hiring
people. 

[00:25:39] **Michaela:** Yeah, exactly. That's that's also what I. Especially
when you're like, when I was completely bleeding footsteps and, you know, even a
$10 subscription somehow really string because they add up, right? Like they add
up and if you're really making zero money, it's like, oh my God, how I'm going
to do that. But then if you, if you're a little bit profitable, I think automation
is really a wonderful step to say, well I'm paying like 10 bucks for Calendly, 
for example. And now it does all the magic and sends email reminders and whatnot.
Right. And thinking about how much time I would have to spend here to do that. Yeah.
So in the end, you're always, is it something like, would you say that you are
getting a salary right now? Do you try to, to really you are sustain it as well?
Or are you saying well I'm as a founder right now, I'm investing my time for free?

[00:26:27] **Karl:** Yeah, I do take a salary, you know, since the, since it
started one of my, I don't know, one of my, my goals with it was like, I do want
to pay myself something. I definitely make less than I did as a CTO to start out. 
I'll say that, but you know, to your point, like I'm investing my time centrally 
into the business. So I'm working at a discount to pay for the company to grow, 
which is, you know, a fair deal for a lot of entrepreneurs, you know, with a 
service business like ours. there's different kinds of companies, right? Some 
companies like a software as a service kind of tool, you can probably take, you
probably have to take no salary for longer because it takes a long time to ramp
up to the amount of revenue that you can then pay yourself. But with a service 
business like ours, that's pretty high dollar. We make a lot of cashflow into. 
We've got to like, essentially I wanted to build into our cost structure, a 
person like me to run things because it's not like I, even if I didn't work in
the company, somebody would have to do what I'm doing. So I don't think there's
a way that you can run this business as a real business without having somebody 
in that seat. Even if I'm working at a discount to help keep things going a 
little longer. I still have to budget something for this in the future. So I 
think that's important. I also think that it, again, like, kind of is like business
fundamentals. You want to set your business up in a way that it is realistic.
Like if, if you make a small business and it. Like pays you anything like you've
just made yourself like I mean, that's really terrible, you know, that's a lot 
of work to get nothing out of it. You may never get to a point where you can 
sell it or whatever you don't know. So I think you at least have to cover your 
basics, but I do, you know, I think it's also, I would prefer to invest more back
into the business than to take more out at this point. I don't really need a ton 
of cash, I guess. 

[00:28:12] **Michaela:** I personally always think that you have to love the way
and the progress, right? Not only that, because otherwise you could really end
up with a lot of regrets. So unless you sat, right, you probably don't. I mean,
it depends on how much you need right now from a supportive perspective on no,
how much money cashflow do you need right now to feel good and then you can 
invest into your business and the growth and that's the end goal. But I also 
think like if you're starving on the way, it's not that it's not just the right.

[00:28:53] **Karl:** I mean, it depends, you know, if you've got a bunch of
money that you've saved up and that can be your bankroll for a while. Sure, 
you might be able to do that. But, everybody's circumstances are different. 
Like I knew that I didn't have that, so I couldn't start a business that was 
going to take me two years to pay myself. It just, wasn't an option. I've got a
family to help support, you know, so for some people, I think alot of engineers 
who want to become entrepreneurs, they think like, oh, I'll just builda software
product. And that's the, you know I'll grow it. But the time required to grow,
that is huge. And the amount like you have to think and be realistic with yourself, 
about how much runway as we call it, do you have to make no money? And if you 
don't have a lot of runway to make no money, then maybe that's not the right 
kind of business for you. Maybe you need to think about like, eh, is there 
another more service business where you can get some more cash in the door early
or is there a info product or a course kind of business, you can start where 
you get more money in the door, early, things like that.

[00:29:45] **Michaela:** Yeah. I also think that, I mean, even if you do a
software product, really trying to gab people paying for it as early as possible
is super, super valuable because it keeps you honest. Right? Like having 200
people sign up for freestyle. You know, feels really good from, from an endorphin
perspective or dopamine, but is it? Are you actually on the right way?
And you don't want to feel like invest all the time three years and say, well,
you know, I'm investing all of my time and you know, which is, I think a
very noble goal to do, but then after three years you realize, actually not 
that I want to charge for it. You know, nobody's really interesting. So actually
starting with something and putting a price tag on it, I think is a really good 
strategy also to know whether or not that is valuable, right. Or, or how to 
tweak it, that it becomes something that people want to also pay for. And for 
engineers, it's not that easy. I think engineers is a specialist species that 
are, I was actually talking with my husband lately about what are we paying for?
And there are a couple of like the IDEs are all free. I mean, he's actually
paying for his,

[00:31:02] **Karl:** I do pay for mine too, 

[00:31:05] **Michaela:** but a lot of them are free and they're really good. And
then the other tools are all also free or either the organization pays for it.
Yeah, I dunno. I think we are, we are too bunch._(laugh)_

[00:31:20] **Karl:** Yeah. I mean it is. But the other thing to think about one
thing I've found that was surprising until I started the, this business was that
your pricing will determine your market in a lot of ways. So for example, just 
in draft.dev's case, if I charged half of what I do, I could probably open
myself up to different kinds of customers that I don't have today.
But the downside is, you know, we wouldn't have the money to hire other people.
So we wouldn't be able to do things at the scale we're doing. And so we'd have
to scale way down. We'd have to be very limited in who we worked with and it
would just be a different company and there's nothing wrong with that.
There, it just is like different price points end up enabling you or pushing you
into different market segments. And so when you go with the free market segment,
like you said, that may not be the people who you actually need to pay you
later. So companies that do freemium, a lot of times, what they'll try to do is
roll those free subscribers up into a company plan later.
But if you don't have outside investment, that's really hard. It takes a long
time to get there. Yeah. So it, again, it kind of goes to like, be
realistic about if you're bootstrapping and self-funding like, can you really
afford to do that kind of freemium strategy? And like, usually the answer is
probably not.

[00:32:32] **Michaela:** Yeah, exactly. You're right. So. When I get from
what you're explaining here is that you also have a little bit like higher
paying clients, a little bit companies that you have contracts with. So how do
you get them? You were talking about sales. How do you do sales? And you
[00:32:00] know, like how did you get to that?

[00:32:54] **Karl:** So early on what I did was I said yes to anyone who wanted
me to write an article for them. And so what I started to learn was which kinds
of companies, what size of companies, what kinds of teams that are hiring me are
the ones who are least price sensitive or most willing to pay the highest dollar
amount, because they got the most value from the article.
So. You know, for example, I could write the same great article for a team, like
an engineering team that wanted some content for their blog. As I could write
for a marketing team that wanted content to put out to the public to make sure
that engineers knew about their product. It could be the same article that was
just as good.
But that marketing team would pay me two to three times as much as an
engineering team would because that article leads directly to revenue for the
company. So it's a totally different business model and sit like you have to
think about that. When you think about pricing services, there's a guy out there
named Jonathan Stark who talks a lot about value based pricing.
And while I don't, I wouldn't say we're like a value based price service
entirely. We think about that a lot, because what he's saying in value based
pricing is you should charge. The amount of value a client gets from your
whatever work, your service. If an article is, let's say for our case, like if a
company can clearly make $2,000 of revenue from one article, we write over the
course of a year or two, let's say our articles are a great investment.
You know, that is a clear winner and they will pay us, you know, up to that,
whatever, probably half of $2,000, a little more or whatever. So that's that
side one. If on the other hand, the company is not sure of their revenue per
article like that. They don't know how many visitors it's going to attract.
They're really nervous about that. Or maybe. They know that each article only
gets $300. They're never going to pay for our services. They're not a good fit.
And so that's where, like, to me, the hard part of sales quote
and quote, is figuring out who the ideal target market is that has the willingness
to pay and actually gets a good value out of our service.
Um, and so the clients that, you know, sure. I have people all the time and say
like, yeah, you guys are too expensive. That's totally fine. We are not set up to do
that kind of low cost work, but I have a lot of clients that think we're a great
value and they probably would pay more if we charge more. But like, you know,
there's a sort of a limit to where yeah.
The pricing pushes you into different markets. And so anyway, I think that the
big part of sales is figuring out how to narrow down your market as much as
possible. And so for us, it's like started off as just like, we'll write any
technical content and then it got more narrow and it's like, Technical content
aimed at software engineers, but then we started to narrow down even further to
like start ups who are trying to hit, trying to get in front of software
engineers from their marketing teams.
And so now we're like super narrowed down and it makes it really easy to have
sales calls, like, because I basically know there's only a few hundred companies
in the world. Need to work with us anyway. So it's a really small list. They all
know each other's, there's lots of introductions and referrals. So you know
what, we're not going to be like the next Facebook size company ever.
That's fine. We're doing really well in the small thing that we're good at. 

[00:35:38] **Michaela:** Hmm. And so you're also doing direct, you going to a
head of marketing and pitching deeper, or how do you, and do you use
like LinkedIn or sites like that to find those? 

[00:35:52] **Karl:** I don't do a lot of outbound. You know, there's
kind of two kinds of sales and marketing and it's called outbound or inbound.

I am not much of an outbound outreach to people kind of sales person every now
and then I we've tried it a couple of times. It's just like, I don't like it. It
doesn't seem to be that productive. We do mostly inbound and referrals, which
means that people see the content we're writing out there in the internet and
they say, oh, that company did a good job.

Let's go talk to them. Or they see, they talk to a, another client of ours who
gives them the recommendation or they see maybe, I share a lot of things on
LinkedIn and Twitter. And so they, they see that and they contact me directly
through that. We're also doing some like meetup groups and conferences, things
like that too, to kind of get the word out a little more.

To be [00:36:00] honest, like at this point we've had enough business from this
inbound stuff that we haven't needed to do a lot of direct outreach. So I think
that's ideal if you can get that set up, but it does take, I mean, I spent a lot
of time building a reputation and the connections and networks. So like, that'd
be hard to replicate if you were somebody earlier on in your career.

[00:36:56] **Michaela:** Yeah. I'm also completely a hundred percent
inboubd because there's just like this. I don't want to do it. Like you know 
whenever I get an email from somebody, I don't know, it feels like spam, but I 
don't want them to be that person. _(laugh)_. Like, I don't know, like it's also 
mindset obviously, right. because I know a couple of really, really wonderful, 
safe people that I alsotried to learn a little bit about, and it never feels like
they do it in a way that it doesn't feel like, you know, it's this LinkedIn 
message that you get like that, you know, went out to 1000 people and drinks the 
same rate. So, but yeah, I've never, I've never tried it and I'm not really 
eager to try it anyways, but yeah. So it's inbound. Right. So do you write on 
your own blog as well? Do you write content for yourself or content marketing? 

[00:38:03] **Karl:** Yeah. Oh, quite a lot. I try to write at least an article
or two a week, sometimes more. Yeah, I, so I write for my own personal blog and
then the draft.dev company blog quite a fair bit, although I've been trying to
get more writers for that as well.

And then guest blogs, whenever they come up, whenever people just happen to see
something and want, want me to write about? Yeah. I think writing is a really
powerful career booster. Even if you don't become self-employed as an engineer,
I was just talking to one of our writers the other day and they were telling me
about how.

Writing this article on some new technology. I don't even remember what it was,
but they got to write this article on a cool new tech that they'd never used at
their day job. And they now get to put in their resume, you know, Hey, I've
worked with this and look, I can prove it. I've got an article out there that I
wrote, and that's really powerful because like at our day jobs, like as a
software engineer, I would usually get to work in like one or two languages, 
one or two frameworks at a single company because a company doesn't want to 
have 30 different tech tools they're using. They don't always want to experiment 
with the newest things. It's not worth it. But with written content, a blog 
posts, you can go explore and try the try five or six new things over the 
course of a year and get those published. And now you've got proof that, Hey, 
I know all the cool new stuff that's been happening. So I think even if you 
don't go, the self-employed route, there's a lot of advantages to writing, but 
if you do go the, like become a freelancer or consultant or starting a 
business, having all this writing out there on the internet is extremely powerful.
I mean, there's people who reach out to me because of articles I wrote three or
four years ago. And so it's just this like compounding interest effect of good
content being out there. And so you just never know when that stuff's going to
really pay off for you. 

[00:39:44] **Michaela:** Yeah. I totally totally see that, but it also
takes really long time.Like if you want to write an article you have no idea 
about that tech it really takes time, right. Especially if you want to. I mean,
probably an introductory to something is quite easy to ride, but when it gets 
a little bit more substantial that it's definitely like, for example, I'm thinking
about all studying analysis tools that I analyzed over the last weeks, so I'm 
thinking about what I'm going to do with it. And if I'm going to create a YouTube 
video out of it or blog posts, definitely. I mean, I don't know how long are you 
people spending on a blackboard. It probably would spend from my own blog post, 
it would take me several days to do that. To have that blog posts that you want 
to bring out there. How is that for you? How long do you spend on an article?

[00:40:35] **Karl:**  There's definitely different kinds
of articles that require different levels of time, commitment and research and
all that. But I think you do get, I've gotten faster at writing since I've been
doing it more.I'll say that I, you know, before this year I probably wrote a 
blog post a week on average, you know, maybe. 2000 words or a little less now I'm
writing a couple of week and having written even more, some at some point 
throughout this year, I've really taken that average time way down. So I don't
really have a, I don't know what, I don't have an hour number or anything like
that, but I do know it's like usually with a good solid day, I can finish up a
single blog post unless it's something really, really specific, and then maybe 
it's a two day thing. Its whether you should invest the time to get faster and 
better at writing blog posts. I don't know. That's, uh, you know, depends on 
what your goals are and what you're looking at do, but even just writing one a 
month, you know, you think about, again, like this compounds over years.
And so one blog post a month is only 12 a year, but then you do it for five
years. And now you're talking like 60 blog posts. That's a lot, like a lot of
people never write 60 blog posts in their life. So I think there's some just,
you have to think about doing things consistently over time and the value of that.

[00:41:45] **Michaela:** Yeah, true. And do you, do you use any software for,
you know, helping you with the writing process? For example, the Rome research
would be one, or I'm using obsidian. It's a, it's an open source version, which
is very similar to it, which I think is a good way to, it's like a second brain
and you can link your resources.
And I think it helps with writing. I recently started like half a year, but do
you use something like that for your, for your process to, you know, keep track
of what you read and what you want to write about your ideas? 

[00:42:15] **Karl:** So definitely I keep what journalist call called like a swipe
file or marketers called swipe file of ideas and things that I think about
throughout the day or week or year, I do keep a swipe file.
And then I also, as I start to like refine a topic, I start to create an outline
of like, what ideas do I need to include in this article and how do they link
together? So it's, it's really hard to write. Just boom, like bam out of blog
posts without doing some research and, and outlines for me first. And actually I
think this is one of those, like, time-saving hacks that a lot of people don't
do, they just jumped straight into writing. And so then they get this mess of 
like ideas and then trying to fix it all later. It's really hard. If you spend 
more time researching and outlining organizing, it usually comes out better. And
then I, you know, on the back end of things, like I use Grammarly pretty heavily 
because I go into back to my, I'm not a detailed person. Like I've gotten better 
and faster at writing, but at the same time, I missed punctuation and like 
spelling and all the little stuff. Right. So Grammarly is kind of my savior 
there. I always highly recommend if you're going to write consistently, I think
it's free. You usually, so there's no reason not to use it. And even if you pay
a few bucks a month, that's it very well worth it. 

[00:43:22] **Michaela:** Yeah. I also use Grammarly and it helps quite a
bit with everything. 

[00:43:30] **Karl:** It's not perfect. And I mean we have
like real editors, human editors as well, because there's definitely things that
won't catch, but it does, it can get some little things that are easy to miss.

[00:43:40] **Michaela:** It's really nice. Yeah. There are a couple of things
that, because I'm not a native speaker, right. So sometimes it corrects me and 
I'm like I really don't think you're right, but I'm not sure who is right now. 
Like, and then sometimes I go with Grammarly and sometimes I just leave my stuff
because I feel like it's not always correct. Right. But I really like it. I can
recommend it as well. Yeah. It's really cool. So maybe the last thing that I 
wanted to ask you is, so you transitioned from software engineer to CTO, right? 
So it means a lot of managing as well. People managing and then doing your own 
thing. I guess this people managing already at the, at the startup already 
helped you to get a lot of those skills that you need now to delegate, to 
understand, to hire people and, you know, to have this, I mean, you have brilliant
large company already within a couple of months, right? So do you think that 
the CTO role and the managing role really prepared you and in what way?

[00:42:44] **Karl:** Yeah, definitely. There's a couple of key things that
having some roles with startups helped me with. So first I came in as the first
employee, basically at the last two startups I was with maybe first engineer,
but whatever is like within the first four people at the company. So I got to 
see everything. I mean, you get to see the founders going through raising money 
and pitching the investors. I got to see how they hired people, how they dealt 
with cashflow and like deciding, you know, how who's going to do their accounting. 
Like all these little nitty-gritty things that are not engineering, but at the 
same time, you just get exposed to by being in a small business.
So getting to see that firsthand kind of gave me like, oh, okay, those are the
things I would think about. If I started my own business, you know, that was
part one part two was it gave me a huge. A lot of connections in software
startups, which are now kind of my target market for the clients we have. So
that has been really good from that standpoint as well as well.
And then the last thing was not being afraid to hire people, have to fire
people have to give them performance evaluations. Like all those management
tasks you just said, it was super helpful to get the opportunity to do that in a
protected environment. That wasn't my own company where, you know, I think I
tried really hard to be a good manager.
There's a little less pressure when the company doesn't depend on you being a
perfect manager, you know, like there's kind of a I could have made a
bad hire and that's going to happen. It didn't feel that high stakes. Now it
feels a little more high stakes. Cause it's my own business and this is kind of
how, you know, make a living.
So I do think that that helped a lot. Now there's plenty of people who do it
without that experience. But I think for me that having that like level of
experience and background. Did it give me a lot of confidence to make this
easier than it would have been had. I just started this straight out of college
or something.

[00:46:28] **Michaela:** And so what is it, what is the end goal for that
company? How, how large do you want to grow it as large as possible? Or, you
know, like, is there, is there some other areas where you think you could expand
to something different, like other services or other products that you could 
create? 

[00:46:48] **Karl:** Yeah, I don't know, this is funny because like most startups, 
like they go into it, like the fundedstartups, they go into it with a very clear
idea of like how big they want to go and where they want to be, what their target
total addressable market is. Like, I don't really know all that stuff. This is 
a lifestyle business in that, it's fun to run, it's really interesting and 
challenging, and it is paying meenough to get by. So like, I just kind of want 
to keep doing that. Now I do likethe sort of growing, because it exposes me, it 
forces me to learn new things. That's been really fun. So like growing and hiring 
account managers had never hired an account manager before.
So I got to learn what that's like and how do I give them work? How do I keep up
with them? How do we pass things? Right. Like all this really interesting, but
yeah, I just want to keep doing it as long as it's interesting and fun to run and 
figure out is and provides challenges. Yeah. And we'll see, maybe in a year or two 
it'll just keep getting bigger and I'll be out of my control and I'll have to like, 
let somebody who's more experienced, run it or maybe in a year or two it'll like 
the same diseases today. It'll be fun to run. It'd be interesting. I really
don't know. To be honest. 

[00:47:53] **Michaela:** Yeah. I think it's perfectly fine not to know. There
are so many interesting paths that, you know, life can take. And so, yeah, I'm
really, really excited to talk with you about all of that and to see how it grew
out of. I'll keep looking out for the business and probably checking in and ask 
you, how many people do you have now? And I think it's, it's good to be open and
just explore and have fun on the way up, but there's not one right. Way to do
things. Right? 

[00:48:22] **Karl:** That's what I say to engineers all the time who are
like, aren't you afraid you're getting out of the tech or you're getting out of
engineering it's such a good feeling. I, yeah. I mean, maybe at first I was a 
little nervous about that, but to be honest, like your career can take weird 
paths. Like a lot of people have like winding career paths that don't 
necessarily just go linearly from engineer to senior engineer, to lead 
developer, to whatever. Like, so sometimes taking in diversion and doing something
different for a few years or months or something can like open up new 
opportunities if you come back. So if I came back to software engineering, jump
into something a little different than I was doing before, or maybe I'd get 
into the technical documentation or some hybrid skillset. Like, so anyway, 
point being that, like, just because you studied something once for a few years,
doesn't mean you have to do it the rest of your life, that, you know, you don't 
have to commit forever. There's a lot of tangential skills that are, it's good
to be, have some familiarity with software engineering, you know, in the 
background. So explore alittle. 

[00:49:22] **Michaela:** Yeah. And I think, I mean, you're bringing so many new
skills, right? So in addition to the skills that you have, because to be really
fair at one point, like if you're like, let's say you're JavaScript engineer for
five years, for 10 years, like we are both in this industry probably even
longer. I'm definitely longer in this industry.
Right? So what's like me writing Java script for 15 years or 12
years, what's the difference here? Right? So where where's the difference? Well,
when you're exploring something else, suddenly you have a complete different
mental model. Again, you have seen so many other things and then you're coming
back, you're bringing actually so much value to the business, right?
And I think you are probably even a better engineer than just spending your time
just doing this engineering thing without trying to be. Focused on the one thing
that you're doing. So, yeah. And the other thing, maybe so we can wrap that up
is that when I started, when I started my business, I was really like, oh,
there's a right in the wrong way to do things, and I listen to podcasts and read 
books and picked how others are doing it. And I mean, there are so many things 
you can be on Twitter, you can do content marketing, you can do this or that. 
And so it all felt like, oh, if you don't do this right, if you don't have 
thousands of followers on whatever, right. Then you're not going to make it.
And you know, this is all not true. You can do your own thing in so many ways.
You can have a wonderful business without being really online without
having an online presence. You can have like a huge online presence and not a
striving business. Right. So. I think it's really important to understand what
drives you on one thing that you said is like, what gives you energy and what
drains you? And I think this is more important, and obviously you will do things
that drain you for a short time, but you should really try it. Get rid of them 
and get more energy flowing activities and maybe hire people or turn your 
business into something else when you're, when you're facing those draining 
moments I think. 

[00:51:19] **Karl:** Yeah. Those were, that was my exact struggle. When I
first started was feeling the same way. It's so funny you say that like, there
is a quote and quote right way to run a business. I thought, you know, and I
thought like, oh, well, if I don't follow the template, whatever that template
is, which you can't find, you know, like I follow that, then I'm going to screw
the whole thing up, but like, yeah, you're exactly right. Is everybody carves 
their own path. And one of the hardest parts to me about starting a business 
was not having a boss up the chain to just ask questions about like, I've always
been a very independent employee, but at the same time, it's nice to be like, 
So, what do you think we should do here?You know, like, look up, look back and 
just ask your boss questions. There's nobody to do that to anymore. So now, 
I mean, I bugged my wife a lot. I bugged my friends a lot, but like they don't, 
they're not going to know the same thing. They don't have the same interests. 
So like, Hey, anyway. Getting over that is tough and it is something you just 
have to overcome and just be like, you know, go all in on. Once you do accept 
it though, it's really liberating. And yeah, to your point, you can run a 
business a lot of different ways and it's fun if you pursue it that way. 

[00:52:19] **Michaela:** Exactly. The most important thing is there is no right
way. And there are ways that worked for one person. And it's not only how did
executed it or the ideas that it had, but also the circumstances that they have 
been in and so on. And, and I think it's just being sensitive. I think that I'm 
sometimes a person that pushes really hard, which isn't always a good thing. 
Right. So if it takes so much pushing, Maybe, another pass would be better, right?
Like if it, if it takes so much effort, this is something that I try to
realize early on that, you know, if this is now really hard, maybe it's not the
right thing. It's not meant. So try something else, go step back and try it in 
a different way. And then, you know, and then it will work out better, I think.

[00:53:07] **Karl:** That, that's definitely true too. There's a
lot of people who start businesses and think that it must be a grinding uphill, 
battle, both ways. Like it's gotta be so hard and they have to eat ramen for years. 
And like, I mean, I just don't think that that's a hundred percent necessary if 
you're willing to be a little flexible in like what you do and who you serve and 
how you serve them, because there's. Ways out there to make a living, you know, 
with your own business. And they don't, you know, you don't have to just pick 
one and stick with it forever. You can kind of pivot around and move and figure 
out what works best. Find out places where you can actually make a living and 
not have to work 80 hours a week every week. So yeah, definitely want to purse. 
Well, but again, that kind of comes back to your goals. Like, what do you, what 
are you thinking you want to do? Like, do you just have some idea you can't let
go or are you trying to just make a good living and have a lifestyle? Business. 
Like maybe I am. So, you know, everybody's different. Everybody's got their, 
their grand vision, I guess.

[00:54:06] **Michaela:** That's really true. So thank you so much. I think we
are in the, at the end of this show today, is there something that you want to
tell my listeners, something that you want to give them on on the way, if you
haven't talked about?

[00:54:20] **Karl:** If anybody ever wants to cat more about this stuff. I'm on 
Twitter at Karl Hughes. And then, you know, I'm happy to talk to you about like,
if you ever wanted to write some for draft, we always are looking for writers or 
just want to talk business stuff or whatever else, engineering stuff. I love 
helping people out.

[00:54:39] **Michaela:** Yeah. I will link everything in the show notes. So
thank you so much for being on my show today, have a good day. 

[00.54.43] **Karl:** Thanks Machaela.

[00:54:44] **Michaela:** Bye. Bye. 

[00:54:46] _(Outro)_ I hope you enjoyed another episode of the software engineering unlocked
podcast. Don't forget to subscribe. And I talked to you again in two weeks. Bye.
