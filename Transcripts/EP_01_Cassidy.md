**Michaela:** [00:00:00] Hello, and welcome to the Software Engineering Unlocked 
podcast. I'm your host, Dr. McKayla and I open the doors to software companies 
and thought leaders around the world. Today I speak with Cassidy Williams about 
how it is to work remotely for CodePen, porting an actively used software from 
one technology to another, how and why she brings humor into tech and how she 
handles all her side projects. I'm super thrilled for this awesome first episode.
I hope you enjoy it. If you like it, support my work by spreading the word. Tell
your friends about this podcast, share it on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook. I
promise you. I will do a happy dance each time you do it. 

Today, I have to pleasure to be talking to Cassidy Williams. She's a senior
software engineer at CodePen. Cassidy is a super interesting person. She's not
only a developer, but she's also a little bit of a comedian. Her jokes on Twitter
really make me laugh. But overall Cassidy and her achievements are really 
impressive. She worked for Amazon, Alpha Digtal, Venmo, Microsoft, and many more.
And if that's not enough, she has quite a few side projects. And in her free 
time, she builds hardware keyboards. Well, Cassidy also works for a really 
interesting company: CodePen. CodePen is one of the largest communities for 
designers and developers, it's actually a social development environment where
you can showcase your front end code. So there's plenty to talk about today. 
Thank you Cassidy for being on my show. 

**Cassidy:** [00:01:30] Yes. Thank you for having me. 

**Michaela:** [00:01:33] Cassidy, so you live in Seattle, it's actually a city 
that gives, um, access to it gives you access to a lot of high tech and 
top-notch companies, why did choose to work for CodePen? And also, why did 
you choose to work remote?

**Cassidy:** [00:01:46] Yeah. So that's a good question. So I, I originally 
moved to Seattle from New York city. I was, I was living there for a while and 
decided to go for a change of pace and so that's how I ended up here out West. 
And, um, I really liked my time over at L4 Digital. That's where I first 
worked when I moved to Seattle. And then unfortunately it was bought and L4 
Digital is no more. Um, so it was, it was fun working there while that lasted.
And then I, uh, hopped over to Amazon after that. And. Um, Amazon was a great
learning experience, but it was also - I learned both what I liked and didn't
like, and I really learned that I was not a huge fan of of very large companies.

And so that's why I ended up leaving Amazon and switching over to CodePen and 
CodePen is kind of like the opposite of Amazon. Really. It's an incredibly 
small company. We're only eight people. And, um, I would be working remotely 
instead of working from an office. And I always thought it would be fun to be 
able to work remotely because I would be able to have just the flexibility of 
working from anywhere, whether it be from my own house or in a library and a 
cafe, or even a coworking space if I went for that and, um, Yeah, it's, it's
just been awesome so far I've been, I've been really happy working at CodePen.
I've been working on this product that I've been using CodePen for years. And,
uh, the fact that I get to actually work on it now and, and build things that 
I would actually use myself as a developer is really exciting. Um, and yeah, 
that's, that's, that's kind of how I ended up at CodePen. 

**Michaela:** [00:03:17] Yeah, that sounds really exciting. So you're working
for code ban remotely. Is everybody on the team remote? 

**Cassidy:** [00:03:24] Yeah. So technically. Two of the people we call 'Bend 
Oregon', our global headquarters kind of as a joke, because two people live 
there. They, they rent a coworking space together. But besides that, uh, the 
rest of, most of us all mostly work from home from our respective homes. And, 
uh, it's kind of fun because, uh, The designer, Claire at CodePen. She lives 
in Seattle as well. And one of the cofounders at code pen, he's moving out to 
Seattle too. So we've got a nice little contingency here in Seattle, but yes, 
it's a fully remote company. 

**Michaela:** [00:03:57] And so do you think, or do you miss some times, uh, to 
be with your coworkers to hang out over the water cooler or next to the water 
cooler and, uh, Just talk.

**Cassidy:** [00:04:07] Yeah. We actually have a meeting on occasion which we 
call just water cooler time where we just chat and hang out with each other on, 
on the video chat, which is, which is fun. Sometimes I do miss being able to, 
to gab with people, but, um, Not as much as I thought I would. It's been really
nice because I can kind of do work at my own pace and move around wherever I 
need to. I have an office in my home and that's kind of where I try to stick 
and do all of my work. And then when I leave the office, I'm done working for 
the day. 

So I can kind of have that separation. And what's kind of nice about it
is because I'm not talking with coworkers all day and kind of gabbing over the 
water cooler or distracting people with jokes or something. Um, because, because 
of not doing any of that during the day, I have a lot more energy to do 
that in the evenings.And so I've been. Uh, just hanging out more with friends 
and at meetups and doing a lot more outside of work without being exhausted at 
the end of the day, I'm a much more motivated to be social and to hang out with 
people after work. Um, which I see, I see that as a plus because there were 
definitely times in my life where I would really want to hang out with people 
and I would do it, but then I would just be so exhausted at the end of the day 
from all of just the interaction and stuff, and I'm a pretty introverted person. 
And so it's, it's, it's nice being able to work from home to have that separation. 
And, um, I, I can go be social if I want to, by going to a library or cafe. And 
if I kind of just want to just be on my own and get the work done, I can, I can 
do that at home.

**Michaela:** [00:05:48] Yeah, I can relate to that. I really liked the quiet time
at home. You can be so productive working remotely. And uh, and then if you are in 
your work motors, you're in your work motors, right? You are in the flow and 
you're doing what you need to do. And then you have a social time or interactive 
time at different times at different times. 

**Cassidy:** [00:06:10] Yeah.

**Michaela:** [00:06:10] So CodePen is a really small, a relatively small company 
with, uh, eight people. So I imagine that you have a lot of ownership and a lot 
of responsibility. Do you feel that you have of impact by the work that you do 
and, um, what exactly is your responsibility at that company?

**Cassidy:** [00:06:26] Yeah. And so it's because it's small, you really kind 
of wear a lot of hats and you really have to know what you're doing and, and, 
and own that section of the product. A big part of my responsibility is actually
converting the site over to React. CodePen was originally built with Ruby on 
Rails and jQuery way back in 2012. And it was a great technology for its time. 
But, uh, at this point now, uh, it's, it's kind of outdated. And so we've been 
slowly but surely migrating more and more of the site over to React and yeah, 
it's mostly been converting the site to React. We've been adding a lot of, uh, 
graph QL and Apollo to the code base and moving away from just other state 
management stuff. Again, it's, the site is kind of in a hodgepodge where again,
it was originally built in Ruby on Rails and jQuery. Yeah. And then CodePen 
started to introduce React into the code base in 2016, I think.

And that's when they launched, uh, Both the projects editor, the CodePen products 
editor, where it's much more advanced projects rather than yeah, just HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, and, uh, and multi files and stuff. And also the dashboard and those 
were built with React and Redux. And, um, around that time, that's when Redux 
was really having its heyday and Redux is definitely still relevant now, but 
it's not one that, it's not a technology that I've ever really enjoyed. I'm sorry
to all of those who love Redux - it's not my cup of tea, but, uh, it's, it's 
still pretty popular and we, but we've decided that we're moving away from 
Redux and moving into a GraphQL and Apollo for state management and, and also 
just for getting API data and everything.And it's been awesome because it really 
empowers the front end to get exactly the data that it needs and to make the 
right calls and be really modular about it. And also just gives us a really 
good interface for making really extensible and cool components. And it's a 
really awesome technology in general. Like there's a lot less configuration and
if you want to edit a component, you don't have to jump around between reducers
and actions and, and that sort of thing. It's, it's just all in that one 
component, which is pretty fun. But anyway, that was a very long winded way to 
say. I do a lot of things at CodePen but it's mostly the engineering side of 
things and mostly front end, but, I dabble in backup a little bit too.

**Michaela:** [00:08:55] Yeah. So I actually watched the talk that you gave 
recently about those whole transition phase at CodePen that you worked your 
way through from starting with Rails and then JavaScript. And as you said, Redux, 
and now you're actually using Apollo and GraphQL. So for a relatively new company, 
that's a lot of change, a lot of technology change.

**Cassidy:** [00:09:21] Yeah. 

**Michaela:** [00:09:22] And as you said, I mean, you're making the change 
slowly. So in your talk, I saw that parts of it are actually still in Rails 
parts of it, are, you know, in React, parts of it are now in Apollo or something
like that. So how do you handle that all? When you interviewed, what was the 
tech stack that you actually said I'm comfortable with that or, yeah. What were,
what was the interview experience and what did you want from you to demonstrate 
your skills?

**Cassidy:** [00:09:50]  So my interview experience, this is kind of a funny 
story. I actually interviewed with CodePen before I joined Amazon. Um, and 
again, Amazon was a great learning experience and, uh, It was, it was a company
that I really decided it just wasn't a good fit for me. And there are some good
teams there are some bad teams there. Unfortunately, I was on a team that was a
little bit both, but anyway, I interviewed with CodePen at the beginning of 2018.
Um, Is that right? Yeah, time flies, I, intervewed at CodePen at the beginning of
2018, ended up going to Amazon and then about six or seven months into Amazon, I
reached back out to CodePen and I said, Hey guys, can I re-interview with you 
again? And that's kind of how I ended up, uh, getting, getting to CodePen there. 
And, and so when I was initially interviewing with CodePen, they were still very 
all in on Redux. And so my interview, it was. It was technical and also non 
technical in that they were asking me what I was familiar with. They were asking 
about my side projects. They were asking what I was comfortable with. And then 
they gave me a coding assignment and the coding assignment was to just implement
part of their site in a React and Redux. And, um, it was, it was a fun interview
because I was able to kind of mess with code. Like they, they gave me access to 
part of a repository to mess with, um, which was really cool and trusting of them.
And I thought that that was a really good culture indicator. Um, but yeah, I was 
using React and Redux on there. And then by the time I actually joined later in 
August, they were just like, yeah, we're not using Redux anymore. and I was so 
happy, it was awesome. But that's, that's kind of how the interview went. They 
were, they were asking what I was comfortable with, what I could build. And then
when I actually did build it, then, uh, they went over the code with me and, and
I would talk about here's how I implemented it. These are the decisions I made 
and that sort of thing. 

**Michaela:** [00:11:52] So even though you didn't really, you, aren't a fan of 
Redux and React, you were familiar with those concepts. Or did you learn to, you
know, because you wanted the job at CodePen and you knew that that's what it 
takes. So you learned actually, um, what you have to do and you interviewed there?

**Cassidy:** [00:12:10] Yeah. So I already knew the technologies 'cause 
I'd used them at previous jobs. Um, and, and don't get me wrong. I love 
React. I'm just not a Redux fan. And, uh, and so I was aware of the 
technologies and I had used them on different client projects and across 
different side projects and applications. I was experienced with it. And 
I was, if I had to do it, I was going to do it. But man, when I got to CodePen
and they said, we're not doing it, we're doing this other technology instead.
I was so happy. Oh, I was very, very pleased that we got to do something else. 
'Cause I, I didn't find Redux to be very intuitive and that might just be how 
I, that just might be how my brain thinks and, and other people I'm sure that 
they think that something like Apollo and GraphQL is not intuitive at all.
And Redux is the way to go. And that's, that's kind of just how the world works 
and how brains work. But yeah, I was, oh, I was so pleased when I learned that 
I didn't have to do Redux at this gig that I was able to, uh, pick up a brand 
new technology and really learn it a lot and dive in deep. And the entire team 
was kind of learning Apollo and GraphQL when I started to, um, and the first 
project that I worked on was actually the company's first project working with 
Apollo and GraphQL. Yeah, we were all learning together and, and it was great 
too, because we were able to say, okay, we've had this experience we're in and, 
and just went from there and ran with it. 

**Michaela:** [00:13:37] Yeah. I can imagine that if you're starting at a 
company and they all have the same goal of learning that technology, it really 
is also a bonding time. Right. You can help each other out quite a lot. And 
you're somehow starting at the same level, which is really nice as well. Right,
so, yeah, everybody's sort of unfamiliar with that and in a new territory and 
yeah, I think it can be a very interesting experience to get to know your 
teammates and, and the company as well.

**Cassidy:** [00:14:04] Yeah. Yeah. And we, we try to do a lot of pair 
programming where we have a video chat going and we'll work on the same 
code base and commit something and then say, okay, now it's your turn to 
code this and then talk through the code. And so being able to learn together
and code together and build together has been a really fun and a solid learning
experience for all of us.

**Michaela:** [00:14:25] Coming back to the bonding experience, as a remote 
company, do you sometimes get together in one place and, you know, just have 
face to face meetings or just have quality time with each other? 

**Cassidy:** [00:14:37] Yeah. Uh, we've, we've gotten together as a team twice 
since I've joined. And I do think that that's kind of unusual for CodePen to do 
it as so much within a year period, because I'm going to be at Codepen for a 
year this month, actually, which is kind of fun. But, uh, when I first joined,
um, it was very good timing because that's when they were doing their first like
big company, uh, I shouldn't say offsite because it's not like we're ever onsite.
So I guess our big company onsite together and the entire team is getting 
together to talk about, um, just the future of CodePen, things that we want to
build and technologies want to use. And literally that, that week I joined was
when they were doing, uh, this company gathering. And so it was, it was great 
timing. And then, um, later. We had another company get together. That was 
significantly more casual. Cause one of our teammates was getting married. 
And so we, we all flew out for the wedding and we were able to get together 
and see each other in person, just in a much more social setting there.

**Michaela:** [00:15:38] Yeah, that sounds like a good opportunity to, to bond 
and to be together right. And enjoy some time together. So what I also saw on 
your team site was actually that there's a quite high ratio. I think it's half, 
half right of women in - 

**Cassidy:** [00:15:52] Yeah 50% Women.

**Michaela:** [00:15:54] Yeah. Do you feel, I mean, you have worked at other 
places where I think, Amazon and all of those companies don't have those ratios.
Do you feel that it's different? Do you see it? That it makes a difference?

**Cassidy:** [00:16:07] It's awesome. It's something that I've - the different 
companies I've worked for. Some have had better diversity than others, but, um, 
what's great about CodePen is everybody just really respects each other. And 
then if they don't like something they're very willing to call it out. And 
it's, it's a very solid culture in that regard. And, um, one of the, one of the 
other female devs. Uh, Rach Smith. She is based in Australia and she is an 
amazing engineer. And I would, I would venture to say probably the best engineer
at the company, or if not, among the best word, we all know what we're doing, 
but, um, what's great about that. And, and what I saw was when I first joined 
the company, she had recently had a baby. And she was kind of working part 
time because she, you know, had a baby and, um, she was like feeding her kid
breakfast. Like spoon-feeding him food while also talking about advanced 
technical topics on the, uh, video chat. And it was the most amazing thing. 
Cause I was just like, man, she is. She's able to balance all of that. And 
everybody is totally cool with that. And nobody ever questions it because 
she's a good engineer. And, um, it was something that really kind of threw 
me through a loop in a good way. I, I hadn't really seen that sort of a thing
before where people generally respect you in general, if, uh, when you're a 
woman in tech, but, uh, There are, there are plenty of experiences that I 
would say almost every woman, woman has had in this industry that has not been
great. And, um, the fact that I haven't had any of that at all at CoedPen has 
been amazing. And I do think that it is because we have that ratio and, uh, the 
founders are really good at just saying it's good to have people around who 
aren't like us, because then we can get a solid perspective on certain 
concepts that we just don't have because people aren't all just a homogenous 
group. They are the exact same type of people, both geographically and, uh, 
gender wise and also ethnicity wise too. And then it's also good just for 
learning from each other too. Um, the we've had meetings recently where, uh, 
some of the guys were asking questions where they were, they were perfectly 
valid questions, but they wouldn't have ever had the answer to those questions
if they didn't have so many women on the team to be able to explain their 
experiences, uh, in terms of social media and that sort of thing. And so it's,
it's really cool having a team that is so equal in general and, and very 
inclusive. And, and I've been, I've been really happy to work at a place that
is, is so inclusive and so open to talk about all sorts of issues and, and 
good and bad things. 

**Michaela:** [00:18:56] Yeah, that sounds like a really wonderful environment 
to be working in. I also think that if you experience, like, for example, that
a woman, you know, can do both at the same time, I mean, spoon feeding a kid 
and still, you know, talk about, um, it's suddenly, uh, it's a no brainer. 
Obviously you can do that. Right. But right. If you haven't seen it before or
somehow people that are starting to question that, right? And it's like, is it 
even possible? Can you concentrate while you're doing that. Even though 
multitasking, isn't the best thing to do. Spoon-feeding and talking about 
about tech is possible, you know, it's like driving the car and talking is 
possible. Right. So, 

**Cassidy:** [00:19:38] Yeah, exactly. And that's, that's just how life works 
and, and it's, it's awesome that they're so open to that. And I do think that
companies in general are being more and more open to that sort of thing, but, 
uh, being able to actually see it firsthand has been a really cool experience 
for me. 

**Michaela:** [00:19:53] Yeah, I can imagine. So one of the things that I really 
like from your profile as well, or from what you show publicly to others is all 
the jokes that you, that you do. Right? So, um, sometimes I'm really cracking 
about what you put on Twitter and personally, I think that that's also a way of
making tech a more welcoming place. So for me, when I see that it's somehow
lowering the barrier, it's like, it's not, everything is so serious, you know,
we can laugh about it, about ourselves, about failures, you know, maybe also 
about daily life things. Is that, um, is that one of the reasons why you're 
doing that by making those jokes? Why do you spend time on making videos, 
for example, and, you know, What's your point behind that? 

**Cassidy:** [00:20:40] Honestly, I just, I really like jokes and anyone who's 
subscribed to my newsletter, which, by the way, I have a newsletter - 
subscribe. Um, I've been doing that newsletter for like two and a half years now.
And every single week, I make sure I put a joke into it. And I've, I've, I've 
always just been a really big fan of jokes and humor and stuff. And the fact 
that, uh, I can make people laugh and kind of have that just lower barrier to 
entry because they're just like, Oh wow. This person who is an engineer also 
has the same issues that I have and can laugh about it. Like it, it, it does 
kind of make it a lighter and more fun experiences. And ever since I started 
making videos, I kind of started doing it as. A joke. And I was just like, 
oh, it'd be funny if I made this, I'll try it a few weeks ago. And then I was, 
I realized people enjoy the content. And I was just like, well, you know, what,
if I can put some smiles on people's faces, I might as well keep going.

And, uh, I I've gotten several emails and private messages and even just, 
replies on Twitter where people are saying, "Hey, I just wanted to let you know, 
my, uh, younger brother has been learning how to code and he was getting really 
discouraged cause he was having a hard time with it. But then he saw your video 
and saw that you had a hard time with this too. But You could laugh at it. And 
now he's just so much more motivated" and people say, "Oh, you've really made 
my tough day so much better" or "I had this issue yesterday. And so. It was a 
really relevant joke. I was able to laugh about it with my team, and now we're 
kind of, we're motivated to do this sort of thing". Just those kinds of messages
just really make my day. And, and I, I want to be able to bring that kind of 
lightness and humor to development because it's, it is, it is a very serious 
concept sometimes it's a very logical and dry thing to code, uh, at times 
when you're not being creative and making something fun, a lot of times it's
just like, okay, how do I solve this problem that's basically a math problem, 
but I have to apply it to code and make a computer do it. If you, uh, if you 
do that all the time, some people thrive just, kind of looking down at their 
keyboard coding, and then, uh, that's all they do. Um, but for myself, I know
that I, I appreciate being able to laugh at myself and laugh at, uh, the issues
that I continuously have. There have been so many times where I'll be on Stack
Overflow and I'll realize the question I'm looking up is a question I asked two
years ago and little things like that. It's, it's a career that's worth laughing.
Maybe not laughing at, but laughing with. Because we're all going through such
similar experiences. So being able to make jokes to kind of make someone's 
careers or days, or, or even just a couple minutes, just that much better. It's
it's. It's a privilege to be able to do, uh, the fact that people are very open
to that in this community is awesome because I can keep doing it and, and have
a ball on my own and, and, uh, bring happiness to others too.

**Michaela:** [00:23:36] Yeah I think humor is a really powerful thing and it's 
also a really nice way of connecting with each other or connecting with. Well, 
the human side of each other of each other, or failure and fears as well. Right?
You can, you can discuss that somehow in the, not so serious way in a, not so 
deep way. Right. You can consume it easier and you know, you're not opening a 
can of worms, but you're just slightly talking about it in, in a more digestible
way, I would say. At least that's how I understand it. So. Yeah, you said it can
be sometimes a little bit of a dry topic as well. So when you're at your computer 
and you're coding and you're at a problem and you're facing that problem and you 
don't know how to overcome it, what would be your first strategy be to, to look 
that up? Are you Googling it? Are you searching on the web for it or, what's your
approach here?

**Cassidy:** [00:24:32] Yeah. Yeah. So when I, when I first see something I do, 
I do definitely try, had to just make it myself. And if I can't do that, I'll 
see if someone else has run into it. And so I'll Google it. I'll check on Stack
Overflow, that sort of thing. So when I have finished Googling and I don't have
any success with that, um, I have a notebook or something next to me. I always
have some kind of pencil or pen and paper next to me, and I start drawing out 
the problem. Um, and like right next, right next to me right now, I'm looking 
at it. I have a little note where it's just like, okay, here's how I architect 
it. And it's just a little architecture diagram. And then I kind of try to go 
with that. And then if, if that doesn't go well, that's when I just start asking 
questions. And so I'll reach out to my teammates and if they can't help me or if 
they pair with me and also can't figure it out, I'll start asking the internet.
I'll start asking my own questions on Stack Overflow. And that's my general 
approach. I do try to, uh, Do things myself, as much as I can, but I kind of 
have a general rule where if I spend X amount of minutes on a problem and I 
still can't solve it, that's when I just have to start consulting others, 
whether it be the internet or teammates, because, uh, it's very easy to, uh, 
have that pride and be just like, no, I should be able to solve this.
I will solve this and then you don't solve it. And then that's, that's when it 
starts to get particularly discouraging. And so being willing and open to ask 
those questions and to, uh, acknowledge that you don't know how to solve a 
problem, I think is very important. And that's something that, uh, Honestly
I've it's, it's, it's been a learning experience when I first started in my 
career, I was not good at asking questions and I can openly admit that now, 
but then I was much more like I have to be able to do this. I have to be 
perfect. I need, I need to be able to know that I know how old I'm doing, 
but now I'm incredibly quick to say, okay, Hey, Rach or hey Chris, I have 
no idea how to code this thing, but here's what I've tried. What do I do do?
And then they could say, Oh, you just forgot this. And then I can, I can keep
going on with my life. And it's great because I have that direction. And I 
think, uh, where I to give advice to some junior engineer, who's just starting
out, I would say. Man just, ask your questions soon, because as soon as, as 
soon as you get those questions answered, you can move on with your life rather
than just banging your head against a problem and taking a lot longer to solve
it because you didn't ask those questions.

**Michaela:** [00:27:01] Yeah and you're learning right. When you're getting 
the answer you're  learning. And also you're bonding somehow with your teammates.
So because it's a remote company, how do you reach out to your colleagues? You
have like tools that you use at CodePen, uh, to talk to each other, or would 
you old school pick up the phone and talk to them?

**Cassidy:** [00:27:19] No, we're not that old school. So we, we use Slack for 
pretty much everything and you're kind of expected to be on Slack when you're 
online for the day. And, um, if, if someone is not on Slack after certain amount 
of time, you just kind of consult another team member and we try to make it. So 
not everybody is so siloed where that there's only one person that can answer a 
particular question. We kind of try to share the knowledge. And share the wealth
of knowledge, uh, around each other a lot. And so you can always ask someone 
else or, or have someone else ping you. Um, and we also use Notion for almost 
everything. Notion is a really great tool for note taking for building wikis, 
for building spreadsheets, anad documents, and calendars, and a bunch of other
things. And, and CodePen is pretty much run within Notion. We do all of our all
hands documents in there. All of company announcements are in there and 
onboarding and stuff, but also project planning, Kanban boards, sprint planning,
project planning, product planning. All of our documents are in Notion and you 
can mention a team member in Notion that way. And so I'll often mention someone
in a ticket and then if they don't get to it relatively quickly, that's when I 
ping them on Slack. And then almost always, they get back to you on Slack 
relatively quickly. And, um, we always try to have kind of a variety of tasks 
going. So you're never fully blocked because when you're remote, um, especially
if you're on different time zones or something, you're never really sure when 
someone will be online, um, outside of their normal hours or, or if they're 
saying, well, I have a doctor's appointment today, but then I'm going to be on
later, that sort of thing. And so, um, it's always good to on a remote team, 
have multiple tasks that you can be working on. And so if you end up getting 
blocked on one, you can work on the other until someone else's back. And, um,
we we've handled it pretty well. I don't think I've ever been at a point where 
I. I'm just like I can do zero work and I'm just sitting here for an extended 
period of time. There's always something to do. Um, and, and yeah, we've, 
we've been able to manage that pretty well. Mostly Slack and Notion have been 
our main communication devices.

**Michaela:** [00:29:33] So you said, um, you're sharing knowledge so that 
people, so several people can work on the same thing. When you're saying sharing 
knowledge. One of the things that comes to my mind is code reviews. Do you use 
code reviews at CodePen? Do you do code reviews? 

**Cassidy:** [00:29:47] We do. Yes. And so, uh, and that's something that's 
relatively new to CodePen. Like it was something that we, honestly, they 
might've started it around the time that I started at the company. But, um, 
they, they used to be just like, we trust you if you write code, just push 
it. Uh, but now we're, we're a little bit more. We're a little bit more 
cautious in that regard. And we actually do the code reviews now.
And so we, we use GitLab internally and, um, write our code. We push it in and 
it's on a branch and we make a merge request, um, uh, or a pull request. And 
then it's down to just people to look through the code and approve it. And, uh, 
you, we kind of make it where you have a list of approvers. And as long as 
someone on the list has proved it, that means they've code reviewed it,
and they're confident that you did it right. And then that's when you can merge 
it. And that's, that's generally our rule of thumb where if an approver approves 
it, then that means this other engineer or a - even designers or whoever has 
looked through it is happy with it and has set it to merge. So, um, yeah, we're, 
we're pretty, we're pretty new at code reviews, but we're decent at them where 
we, we will never push code just because we want to push code.
We'll make sure that the team is aware of what you're pushing. 

**Michaela:** [00:31:06] And do you see benefits of using code reviews at CodePen 
already? 

**Cassidy:** [00:31:12] Oh, definitely. I think, I think code reviews have 
really prevented a lot of different bugs where, um, we didn't even, we wouldn't 
have even realized they were bugs unless someone else was looking at it.
So yeah, code reviews definitely helped with that. And we've also been working 
more and more on just testing in general, we have unit tests which goes through 
mostly our utility functions and specific components that kind of have one 
function in general. And, and we make sure those work individually, and we also 
use Cypress for integration testing and that will say, okay, go to this page.
Does the header render great. Does the sidebar render great? Does. This or 
that render does this value, do this when you click on that, that, that sort
of thing. Um, and so we've been, we've been implementing tests a lot more and
between all of the testing and then continuously running those tests, whenever 
we push to GitLab and then doing code reviews, those, those checks in place 
have really helped us just push less bugs and, uh, ultimately just be better 
at engineering what we want to build. 

**Michaela:** [00:32:18] And who makes those decisions to, for example, have now 
code reviews or, you know, double down on tests and things like that, or even 
which technology choices you're going to make. Is that a team decision or is 
that something or is that something that's more really from the founders of 
the company? How is that decided?

**Cassidy:** [00:32:42] Yeah, so that, that's a good question. And it kind of 
depends on the thing. Typically it's a team decision. For example, we were 
looking into, I forget what library recently, we were looking into some library 
recently and, and one teammate was very for it and another teammate was not. And 
so someone else was like, okay, I'll experiment with it and then I'll report 
my results. Then after experimenting with it, they're like, yeah, we're not 
using this library at CodePen. And, and that was that. And so we were pretty 
good about, uh, having those kinds of team discussions and making it so we 
all have input on that. It's not just the founders making those decisions, 
um, which has been really nice to, uh, to see and be able to have that level 
of trust with each other. And I think in terms of product direction, that's 
more on the founders where they'll say, okay, these are the general things 
that we want to be at, uh, or, or the general things we want to build by 
the end of the year. And then in terms of timing and figuring that out sort 
of thing out that that's when it starts to be a whole team situation.

And, um, we, relatively recently, uh, started a new project planning process 
where before it was a little bit more ad hoc, but we're trying to be a little 
bit more methodical about it. Where if someone wants to work on a project, or if 
two people want to work on a project, we have a doc that we write and it's, it's 
not super long. I, I, Coming from Amazon and Amazon, they are very into 
documentation and they'll say, okay, if you want to build this, write a six 
page document explaining why we're, we're not so much like that, but we'll say, 
okay, here's what I want to build. Here's the business reasonsw why, here's 
the dev reasons why here's why I think we should. And let's discuss it. And 
then we'll have, uh, just a mini team meeting about it and discuss what we want 
to build and what we don't want to build. And that comes from the team that can 
come from the founders. But, uh, in general, uh, we're, we're pretty good about 
working on everything as a team and being able to say, okay, this is, this is 
what I want. This is what I don't want. And, and, and that sort of thing. 

**Michaela:** [00:34:45] So at CodePen, you have several hundred thousands of 
users and. I guess you try to align the features that you built with the user 
base that you have, and then also to well, make it attractive for new users as 
well, to hop on to your platform. What exactly, what are the steps that you 
would do to understand whether or not a feature is actually worth your time 
and how do you get these inspirations? Is that part of your job as well? Or as
you said, is it really something that the founders. Well think about, and is it 
their responsibility? 

**Cassidy:** [00:35:24] Um, it's, it's not, let me think. That's kind of a 
founder thing. Um, one of our teammates, Marie, she's the head support person 
at CodePen. And, uh, she does a lot of, uh, like data science and research on
the side, in addition to, uh, her regular support of answering emails and 
making sure users are dealing with bugs properly, and then doing bug reporting 
for us, she, she wears a lot of different hats.

Um, but. What she'll do is for example, the founders will say, "Hey, we want to 
know generally, why do pro subscribers stop subscribing?" Let's just say, and 
she will do the work of talking to people who have deleted their accounts or 
unsubscribed. She has, she's a queen of spreadsheets. And is it, and has built.
The most complex formulas ever in these spreadsheets to be able to say, okay, 
this is the general reason why these are the general sentiments around this new 
feature. This is, this is how a users are perceiving this or that. Um, this is 
what people generally want, uh, that sort of thing. And she's really good at 
documenting that and everything. And so I would say. Even though the founders 
kind of make the decisions about where the product is going. I'd say Marie, 
and then other team members, but definitely Marie do a lot of the work of 
figuring out what the return on the investment would be and what users like. 
And don't like, and that sort of thing.

**Michaela:** [00:36:48] And do you do something like AB testing as well?
So do you have like some hooks within your product that you can see, you know, 
where they are clicking, what they're doing, how they're using your product that 
you have. 

**Cassidy:** [00:37:00] We've done. We've done certain kinds of that. We have, 
we haven't been very active about, um, about like tracking clicks and 
everything. We, we, uh, mostly just because we haven't. We, we started using 
some technologies for it that worked decently, but weren't a good fit.
And so I feel like if the perfect technology came around, we would be doing 
that a lot more. Um, that being said, if. If we do want to track a certain 
feature, we do have some tools that we use internally. And I honestly don't 
remember all of the names of them, but our lead design person, she is also 
really awesome at just user research and user experience. Um, and, uh, she's 
doing a lot of research and stuff on the side, outside of work too. So she 
she's really good at that sort of thing. And so when she is trying to decide 
between a couple of different designs, she will work on that and, um, then 
actually interview people and see, okay, what do you like about this?
What don't you like about this? Um, watch them interact with the site, uh, with 
certain changes implemented and, uh, She makes decisions based on that. And then 
we as engineers kind of take her designs and run with it and make them come to 
life a little bit more. 

**Michaela:** [00:38:14] Yeah. So one of the things that you talked about was 
these changes that you're actually making on a technological side. So as we 
discussed, you're moving away from Rails and from Redux to this Apollo 
GraphQL set up, and right now you're working with all of those different 
technologies. How does that feel? And, um, what's your plan there to really 
convert the the product into a more consolidated state?

**Cassidy:** [00:38:45] That's good question. There's, there's a lot of 
different, uh, plans and everything, but luckily it's, it's been going pretty 
well. Um, mostly because we, the sites already implemented whenever we make 
major changes, those are kind of separate from conversion projects. And so we 
have projects that are more just convert this chunk to React, but then we also 
have. Convert this chunk to React and add this feature to it or something like 
that. And we try to make it so each of these little projects kind of build up 
to, uh, setting up the site for success for another project down the line. And 
so we have kind of a mini timeline going, uh, at all times of of what projects 
will be going on next.

And so, um, one of, one of the things, for example, that we implemented 
recently, In React was the homepage. The homepage was very, very, uh, Ruby on 
Rails driven. And if you saw my talk that you mentioned you, you saw that. Um, 
and, uh, what's great is that talk, even though I gave it only a couple months 
ago, it is out of date now because the homepage is now completely in React now.
And, um, what was exciting about building it and React is once, once that was 
done, we had, uh, a new grid system for, uh, showing items like pens and 
projects and posts and that sort of thing. Um, we built a new grid system for 
that in doing that with the homepage. And we were able to then take that to the 
explore pages where if you wanted to explore popular pens or pens from people 
that you follow or, um, posts that are picked by the, the team.

Um, those things is where the next chunk that we implemented in React. And what 
was great about that is we were able to pull in the grids from the homepage and 
use those as generic components in the explore pages. And then as we were doing 
the explore pages, we were able to say, okay, let's actually start moving away 
from Ruby on Rails, routing and move into React routing. And we started with 
reach router and then. Uh, because of that project, we were able to determine, 
okay, this was cool, but we're going to move over to React router. Cause 
there's a lot of hooks and stuff coming to, uh, React router that we were 
excited to use. And so we were able to convert a lot of that with that 
project, and that led us to be able to convert another chunk of the site to 
using both React router and the grids. And anyway, all this being said, we 
were able to use all these different technologies that we've been building 
to implement the site in React faster and faster and bigger and better. And, 
um, right now the, the part of the, that I'm working on it is using all of 
those different little projects to enhance the current one that I'm using.

And, uh, Yeah, it's, it's been, it's been fun. It's been interesting. And, uh, I 
think a lot of users aren't even realizing the benefits that they're getting 
from all of this conversion of the site is significantly faster than it used to 
be and it's only going to get faster and we're kind of slowly, but surely moving 
to a more, a SPA - single page application - type of experience. And, um, it's. 
It's only going to get better from here on out. And, uh, there's a lot of really 
cool things pipeline that I probably shouldn't talk about before we, before we 
get closer to, uh, to actually building them. But, um, I'm sure I'm really 
excited for where CodePen is going just in the next few months, if, if not, 
uh, the next few years. And, um, there there's a lot in the pipeline and so keep 
an eye out. 

**Michaela:** [00:42:21] Yeah. So what I get from what you explained right now 
is that you moved actually to this new technologies, because it allows you 
to build the site in a much more modular way, but also to increase that speed 
after of the web application and to have a better and more. Well a more modern
user xxperience where you have this single page application. Yeah. Just parts 
of the side can refresh themselves. Right. Instead of off having to refresh 
the whole, whole site, is that, is that the main motivation for those technology
changes at CodePen? 

**Cassidy:** [00:43:00] Uh, no, I mean, it's, it's a really large bonus.
Um, really a lot of the site is we're working to make it because like you said, 
it's becoming more modular. We're trying to make things so much more modular 
that when a lot of the new features that are coming soon, that I can't talk 
about, when a lot of those features start showing up they will be significantly 
easier to implement. Um, the way the site was built a year ago. Um, there a lot
of it, so much of it was in Ruby on Rails and jQuery that a lot of the modern 
things that we want to do in a lot of the new features and aspects of the site 
that we want to build, just honestly, weren't really possible. Like we could 
do it, but it would take a lot of work and then maintaining, it would be a pain 
to, to work on. And so in doing all of these things, we're, uh, kind of setting 
the stage for a lot more new features to come in. In addition to the speed and 
the better developer experience, it's going to be a lot better for users because 
more new features and more, more exciting things are going to be able to come, 
uh, more often, a lot faster. And, uh, just overall it'll be a much better 
experience. 

**Michaela:** [00:44:15] Yeah. Sounds very exciting. Yeah. I recently read an 
article about how Slack actually modernized their UI and they also did it piece 
by piece when it just replaced, you know, the old UI with, with pieces of the 
new UI and they found it really interesting, um, because it's somehow,
tackling the problem of, should you rewrite your code right. Should you rewrite 
from scratch and how you're going to approach that. And, um, so when I saw your 
talk and how you actually approach it with CodePen, it really reminded me on how 
Slack rewrote their UI, just to modernize that, give a better user experience.

**Cassidy:** [00:44:55] Yeah, it's good to do it. It's good to do a piece by 
piece because it, otherwise it'll just take too long if you do it piece by 
piece then. Yeah. Especially if you make like small styling changes and stuff, 
that can be progressive. And then users, aren't just like, Whoa, everything's 
different. I hate that. We can do things that make it slowly, slightly 
different. Um, While also changing the technologies and, and so making the 
site look better, feel better. And then also under the hood, just work a lot 
better too. 

**Michaela:** [00:45:26] Yeah. Yeah. And as you said, I think that some of 
the changes are maybe nonfunctional, so it's harder for users to really 
understand what's going on. And so if they have gradually smaller changes and 
smaller adjustment, they can also feel that it's better. Right. They have this 
feeling of it's a, there's a progression, you know, and there are good things 
to come. So. Maybe one of the last things I wanted to talk with you before 
we are ending is just side projects and how you handle that. I saw that you 
did a lot of hackathons, for example, then you have, you have your, your 
jokes and Twitter. That probably take also quite a chunk of your time. 

**Cassidy:** [00:46:10] Yeah. Less time than people think 

**Michaela:** [00:46:14] it comes naturally, right? 

**Cassidy:** [00:46:15] Yeah. I'm ~hilarious~. 

**Michaela:** [00:46:20] Um, how do you handle that? How do you handle that and 
how do you integrate that with your, with your work environment? I also saw 
that you are actually have been an evangelist before, right? Where I think being 
more public is more of your role. Is that right? Still something that's part of 
your job description at CodePen, or is it really something that you say it's 
all in your free time.

**Cassidy:** [00:46:41] Yeah, so, so speaking at conferences and meetups 
and hackathons and stuff that used to be part of my job and, uh, and I loved it.
I, and I still do love it. Speaking at events is a really good time because, uh, 
you kind of get to see that aha moment when developers finally, uh, understand 
how something works and, uh, both to entertain and to inform it's, it's really, 
really fun. Uh, to, to do that. And. I kind of moved away from it being a part 
of my job for awhile, mostly because it, it was really just kind of life 
consuming.

I was traveling a lot on weekends as I was speaking constantly when I was, when 
I was really kind of in, I don't want to say my heyday cause I sound so ancient, 
but kind of a, when I was, when I was really in the heyday of, of speaking 
regularly. Um, there, there were some points where I was speaking every single 
day for two weeks straight, both on the weekends and on the weekdays.
And I was just burning out constantly. And it was, it was rough because I was 
doing it because I liked it, but I was also kind of obligated to do it because 
it was a part of my job. And so now, because it's not as much part of my job, 
I'm able to speak at events that I want to speak at, not just because the 
company wants me to speak at them and, uh, I'm able to still like kind of plug 
CodePen because I work there and stuff.

So it's advantageous for the company, but also I'm able to kind of do it on my 
own time and determine my schedule where instead of speaking every other week, 
uh, and traveling every other week to a conference, I travel maybe, three or 
four times a year for a conference and speak more locally and, and, and kind of 
have a little bit more balance in that regard and then, uh, with regards to side 
projects that are not speaking or being silly with jokes or something like that, 
the keyboards, and then just coding projects and stuff in general, that's 
something that, um, I just really love, I love being able to build things and 
that's, that's kind of why I like coding and why I chose this profession to 
begin with. Um, I love being able to build things with my brain, with my hands,
and then in general, and I've, I've said many times if I were to ever retire 
from software engineering, I'd love to be some kind of woodworker or carpenter 
and just build things. I love it. And so I kind of got into keyboards, um, and 
anyone who follows me on Twitter will know that I am into mechanical keyboards 
and probably talk about them too much. I got into them when I was living in 
New York, but I didn't really have time to experiment with them much. I was 
more just learning a lot and watching from the sideline saying, yeah, keyboards 
are cool, maybe someday. And then when I moved to Seattle, I dove in deep and 
it turns out the community here in Seattle is one of the biggest in the world 
actually.

And it's a blast and these sorts of things, they are, they seem silly, but 
they're, they're really important to me because I'm able to kind of give back 
to communities and also kind of just exercise some creativity and do things that 
I'm interested in. And I love being able to mess around with my keyboards.
I'm looking at them now as I speak, they're there and I, I there's memories 
attached to them. As I built certain keyboards, I was at a certain time in my 
life. There's stories attached to each one of my keyboards and it's fun because 
I get to build something, it's creative, I get to make it aesthetically pleasing, 
but it's also functional. I get to actually use these things in my work and get 
pleasure out of typing with a different type of switch when I, when I switched 
around with them and, uh, and programmed the electronics to do exactly what I 
want, where I can add my own little macros and then functions and stuff into 
my boards. And so that's kind of where the keyboards come from, but in general, 
uh, for side projects and having the freedom to work on things, and it kind of 
all comes down to, I love being able to build and be creative and work on things.
And luckily with the flexibility of my remote job and, uh, just. My company in 
general and kind of the way I've, I've set up how I want it to work and how I 
want to play, uh, for lack of a better word. 

Um, I've, I've been really blessed to have the opportunity and the privilege 
to, uh, have that flexibility, um, in my work life balance and, uh, just in 
what I want to do. And, um, What I would say to anyone out there who is still 
listening to me, ramble. Um, if you're right interested in some kind of side 
project or some kind of thing, kind of figure out why. Um, I was really building 
side projects initially, because I was like, Oh, if I have a lot of these, it'll 
help me climb the career ladder. And now that I'm at a point in my job where 
I'm very content with where I am in my career. I don't need to be a CEO. I'm 
very happy being a developer, doing developer things and coding. Um, I build 
side projects because I genuinely get enjoyment out of them. And so I work on 
side projects, not because they're good for my career, but because I'm genuinely 
interested in a certain type of technology or in learning a certain thing or 
in just being creative with something.

And kind of getting to that point was. Oh, a weird transition for me, I 
guess. That's what maturity is. Being able to determine, uh, what you're working 
for, uh, with purpose rather than, uh, Just kind of trying to get to the next 
big thing. Um, and so between building keyboards, learning how to laser cut, 
messing with different technologies, even trying out game development, um, just 
a bunch of fun things that I really like to experiment with between all of these 
different things. That's really how I've, uh, I've made time for those things, 
because I care about those things and I've set up myself at work so that way I 
can make time for those things. And, um, There was this song that came out. Um, 
I forget when it came out, but I know that it was in, it was in a very obscure 
movie that some people love. Some people have never heard of some people didn't 
like called 'A Prairie Home Companion' based on the radio show and the song 
lyrics that really stuck with me. Um, It's a, it's a song called 'The Day is 
Short'. The chorus is, "the day is short, the night is long. Why do we work so 
hard to get something that we don't even want?" And, uh, But those lyrics. 
When I, when I heard that, that really stuck with me, I want to work for something
that I want to do. I want to work for something. So that way I can have the 
flexibility at work, to have kids someday and, and be at a place where I can 
be spoonfeeding my kid. And also talking about advanced technical topics.

I want to be at a job where I can work on a bunch of different, interesting 
hobbies. And things that are just interesting to me and fun to me without having 
to stress out about, uh, getting my job done for someone else at a company. 
Um, and I've, I'm getting closer and closer to that goal of, of having all of 
that flexibility. And it's really, really exciting. And, um, I think. To all 
those out there, figure out what you do want and figure out what you are 
working towards, not just to have that certain position. So that way you can 
say, yay, I've made it, but figure out what really does make you happy. What 
really does motivate you to get up in the morning and to do your job and how 
can you tailor your career experience to work towards that. So that way you 
can really just not only enjoy your job, but also enjoy the things outside 
of your job too. And, and, uh, know that your worth is not just in your work, 
but in, in your whole self and bring your whole self to work and have that 
ability to bring your whole self to work. And also, uh, Be able to be your 
whole self outside of work and not constantly be stressed about what's going 
on at the office. This kind of turned into a really big philosophical ramble, 
but that's that's, I hope that generally answered your question. 

**Michaela:** [00:54:47] Yeah, it answers my question. I think I can relate to 
so many things that you said. I think it's really this drive that you have for 
projects or for things that just give you fulfillment, that gives you joy, 
that you value that you just really like to do. But I also think that even having
this, um, as an end goal or as a goal is already too much. Try out some stuff, 
you know, have, have a project, have a side project, and then if you figure out, 
actually that's not for me, you can drop it and it's it's okay.

**Cassidy:** [00:55:19] Yeah, it's good to experiment with your life. 

**Michaela:** [00:55:22] Exactly. Yeah, it's good. And don't be afraid because 
you're not sure if it will stick, it will show itself if it sticks or not. And 
I think it's just, I think the most important thing is to get over that fear 
of trying out the different things, try it out and see, and then also. Be 
relentless with just letting it go again. It's okay. Yeah, we tried, for 
example, I don't know, blogging, or you tried public speaking and you figure 
out it's not for me. Let me move on to something else and try it out. And I 
think we cannot know before we tried it or, you know, we experienced it. 

**Cassidy:** [00:55:58] Yeah, there's a, there's a gal, uh, Rebecca Garcia.
And she gave a really good talk once that stuck with me. And she said, when 
you're building not only your personal brand, but just also like your career for 
yourself, it's just as important to know what you like as it is to know what you 
don't like. And, uh, sometimes it can be as simple as for example, I loathe C++
that language has broken me. I do not like it. And so I avoid all projects and 
all jobs that would involve me getting close to C++ that's just, that's just 
me. I'm not saying everybody should dislike it. That's just who I am. And I 
think that, uh, having that list, whether it be. As simple as a programming 
language or as big as, I don't even know just a type of work that you want to 
do. Let's just say you dislike consulting or you love consulting and you just 
like product work, something like that. It's good to think about that and be 
aware of that so that you can, uh, you can be fulfilled in your career and, 
uh, not just WORK for the paycheck so much, and it's okay to work for the 
paycheck, but you might as well try to have some fun while you do.

**Michaela:** [00:57:06] I think you can optimize that by little steps. And 
I think that's the most important thing that you, you have this, maybe this 
bigger goal, and maybe you don't even know exactly what your goal is, but just. 
Observing your surrounding and thinking, what little thing can I improve today 
to, you know, make it much more enjoyable for me? I think that's, that's the 
right approach to, you know, tweaking it a little bit. And then over the time 
it's this compound effect that you're actually seeing you're in a place that's 
much more enjoyable. Then a year before.

**Cassidy:** [00:57:37] Right, exactly. Those are those little tweaks really do 
matter. And, um, especially when, just like, it feels rough. There there's so 
many crazy things happening in the political world right now. And on social 
media right now, there's so many things. It's, it's good to kind of figure out 
how you can improve your life or your work or something just a little bit 
incrementally over time, just to kind of maintain a sanity, maintain, maintain 
your ability to get up and go to work in the morning without being too stressed 
about it. And, uh, and without just completely disliking what you do. Um, I 
think that's a really important thing. Yeah. 

**Michaela:** [00:58:17] Yeah, I agree. I agree as well. And I think that's a 
really good, uh, end for us for this podcast. I'm so happy that you have been 
on my show, Cassidy. Thank you so much. It was really a good talk with you. 
Uh, many insights into your work with CodePen, but also how your brain works, 
what you enjoy your side projects and, uh, yeah. Thank you so much for your time.

**Cassidy:** [00:58:40]  Yeah, thank you so much for having m, this was a fun time.

**Michaela:** [00:58:41] Wonderful. Thank you. 

**Michaela:** [00:58:44] I hope you've enjoyed another episode of the Software 
Engineering Unlocked Podcast. Don't forget to subscribe. And I talk to you 
again in two weeks. Bye!
