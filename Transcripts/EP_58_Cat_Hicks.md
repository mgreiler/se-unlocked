Hello, and welcome to the Software Engineering Unlocked Podcast. I&#39;m your 
hosT Dr. McKayla, and today I have the pleasure to talk to Dr. Cat Hicks. 
But before we start, let me tell you about an amazing
startup that is sponsoring this episode Codiga. Codiga is a code analysis 
platform that automates the boring parts of code reviews and lets you merge with confidence on GitHub, 
GitLab and BitBucket. I've worked with Codiga for around one year now, and I love how it guides me in 
discovering the, well, not so
nice parts of my code base. But there is more: Codiga also has a coding assistant 
that helps you write better code faster. Find and share safe and reusable blocks of code within your 
favorite IDE on demand while you are coding. Codiga has a great free plan, and so 
there is nothing that actually stops you from giving it a try. 
Learn more at [Codiga.io](https://www.codiga.io/?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=se_unlocked). 
That is [Codiga.io](https://www.codiga.io/?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=se_unlocked). 

But now back to Cat. 
Cat, or Catherine Hicks holds a PhD in experimental psychology and is a principal 
researcher in Team Lead at
catalysis consulting. She has designed researchers at places like Google Khan 
Academy and co
founded a startup that builds tools for software engineers, and she led multi 
institutional collaborations
in online learning. So I&#39;m super, super, super thrilled to have a cat here 
with me, Cat, welcome to the
show.

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 01:30
Thank you so much. I&#39;m really excited to be here.

**Dr. McKayla** 01:33
Yeah, me too. I&#39;m following you for a long time now on on Twitter. And I was 
very impressed because
you have a similar not the same, obviously very different. But you have a 
similar background, like
coming from academia and then going independent. And and so yeah, so it was very 
interesting to see
how you built Catharsis Consulting. And you&#39;re the founder of Catharsis 
Consulting, right?

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 01:59
That&#39;s correct.

**Dr. McKayla** 02:00
How did it help people with empirical research and also empirical research? I 
really a software
engineering area, and you are now empirical researcher coming from experimental. 
How do you help
companies?

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 02:14
That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right. So it&#39;s delightful to connect. I think 
there are a growing cohort of us out there,
you know, in the world who have made this journey, and there&#39;s not really a 
roadmap for us. So I&#39;m
always I love to talk about it.

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 02:27
I like to call catharsis and evidence-science consultancy. So this means that we 
help partners use
evidence to inform their decision making and tell their stories. And in 
particular, we&#39;re very focused on
meaningful measurement. So I describe it to people as not just data for the sake 
of data, but creating
research methods that give us data that&#39;s fit for purpose. So I try to help 
partners who are trying to learn
something real about the world they&#39;re working in, and how to move forward. 
And we have a couple

areas of competency and special focus. But we&#39;ve led projects, it&#39;s 
easier to give examples right, then
talk high level. So some recent projects are, I&#39;ve asked things like how can 
we find evidence that a
product design change in a language learning game actually increased the 
learning that was happening
for children using the game. Another recent project is using surveys to help a 
small nonprofit tell the
stories of how community members that they worked with, were helping people in 
their own families
and in their social networks, learn about the COVID vaccine and make the 
decision to try to get that
vaccine. So both of those projects, very different scale for those projects, 
very different types of data.
But both of those projects connected to really immediate impact, whether it was 
on product design, or
on an intervention, and programming that help doctors have better communication 
with their patients.
So at catharsis, you know, we try to bring a few core principles to all of our 
research projects. One of
them is just that people deserve to understand their data, and to really use the 
data that they already
have maybe special access to, and to try to bring the tools of empirical 
research to everyone, even
small organizations that may not have invested in learning those skills before. 
So one thing that we
bring in a lot of our partnerships is an emphasis on teaching those research 
methods and taking it not
just from, you know, findings on one project right now, but actually fitting any 
work that you do with data
into a larger plan of moving forward.

**Dr. McKayla** 04:39
Yeah, and it sounds really, really exciting. And it reminds me, I&#39;m more on 
the training side, right. So I&#39;m
helping a lot of software engineers actually get better at code reviews, but all 
of that also based on
empirical research that I did around code reviews, but recently this year, 
actually half of the year I spent
on I&#39;m a research project with this startup and help them come up with a 
framework on, you know, what
makes developers developer experience really great. And they created a product 
out of that. So I can
totally relate to that. And it was really a wonderful experience. But the 
experimental nature of research
and startup somehow there was also a lot of tension, I would say, right, there 
was a lot of, you know,
it&#39;s very different than in an academic world, you have like these 
questions, and here was, every day, I
want to squash the question, is this impactful? Is this impactful? Right? I 
don&#39;t know if you experienced
that as well. And how do you handle that in your work?

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 05:42
I think we all experience right, right, you know, there&#39;s a tension between 
things that you&#39;re doing for the
long term and, and needs that are in the short term, and then, you know, just to 
be really real about it, I
think there&#39;s a lot of people who have agendas about what we&#39;re going to 
find. And yeah. And I, you
know, I try very hard to always work with partners who, who have told me, you 
know, we are going to
make changes based on what we find, even if the changes are uncomfortable to us 
for even if it it, it
helped, we learned something that conflicts what we thought was before, this is 
very important for
social impact work, you know, is very important for equity, when you&#39;re 
going to do anything that has to
do with people&#39;s well being, but it is a core tension. And I think that 
researchers, we tend to be people
who love the truth, right? And we&#39;re just all about finding out the truth. 
And that can ruffle feathers. I
love to do exactly what you described, where you go from working closely with 
people who are living an
experience, and then translate that, you know, to leaders and to organizational 
structures. And I think
it&#39;s a beautiful role to be in, but it requires a lot of invisible work, 
right of explaining both sides to each
other.


**Dr. McKayla** 07:00
Yeah, and, and working with this tension, right, which I think, is tell for me, 
it was a very challenging
time at a time that I learned a lot. Because I&#39;m, you know, for me, the 
rigor of the methodology is the
most important thing. Right? And, and then comes time for the sort of, it&#39;s 
more the time and then the
rigor I think, right? Like, yeah, obviously, you know, like, at least a little 
bit, there is the priority or they
are more stressed by a timing, then you know, then a researcher probably, yeah, 
and so on. So you
have to deal with these tensions. And I think it was a very, very interesting 
learning experience for me.
But what I really love this, that I could see, this research transformed into a 
product. And this was, this
was actually the reason also why I loved academia because I was missing that. 
Yeah, getting real,
right, I created a lot of prototypes in my in my research career, and actually 
think some of them maybe
would even have had some potential even for open source, right, maybe not making 
tons of money, but
some open source software that people would have used. But it was never the 
time. Again, we are
coming back to time, but in a different way. Right. So the time was up after the 
paper is published, the
time was up to work on that. And so I felt like I couldn&#39;t really translate 
it into what I would like to see.
Right. And that&#39;s why I left for example, academia. How is that for you? Why 
did you leave this
traditional path of a researcher and and start your own company and do your own 
thing go
independent? Right?

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 08:40
Yeah, for sure. So you know, I think that it&#39;s interesting because I am a 
researcher who likes to study
environments. So whenever you ask someone about their choice as an individual, I 
think you have to
see it also as a choice about what was around them. So I&#39;ll be uh, you know, 
I&#39;ll be real about that. I
mean, academia is very hard to succeed in, not, not because of the quality of 
your work, but because of
the opportunities that are around. And I but I think that there was a really 
core piece of what I loved. So
I started out working in classrooms, I started working, asking about the 
beginning of how we learn to
learn and even in my academic work, I was very interested in being in real 
schools talking to real
children was where I started I did a dissertation with 3 to 11 year olds, so you 
can imagine Oh, yeah,
yeah, asking young children about their how they were thinking about mistakes 
and how they were
thinking about learning. So from the very beginning, so cool, you know, it&#39;s 
amazing how much it pays
off, right? Because we all we all start there and even now I work with adults, 
you know, and, and yet, all
of the same questions come up all the time. So, you know, I think getting I 
found it beautiful and
amazing that people are constantly scanning around them asking whether it&#39;s 
okay to make mistakes
and asking who they can talk to. And I just, you know, I saw a lot of exciting 
stuff out there in in tech. I
think the journey for me too, there&#39;s a personal, you know, that&#39;s kind 
of the problem space. But being
an entrepreneur is also a way for me to carve out this role that I did not see 
existing. So I always felt a
little bit like, I&#39;m a social scientist and a data scientist. I&#39;m a data 
scientist, who cares, you know, about
how we measure things. I like meaningful data more than big data. You know, it 
felt like with catharsis,
it was a way to make the job that I wanted to have, you know, to do these kinds 
of projects.

**Dr. McKayla** 10:47
Yeah, that&#39;s exactly what I did as well. I love create the job that I would 
like to do that, then that I feel
like I can strive it.

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 10:57

And it takes courage. Yeah, no, you have to have to say, I know this is 
valuable, which I think you do as
a researcher, just like you were talking about that startup, sometimes you have 
to be the person who&#39;s
saying, I know that this will pay off if you will do it, you know, you 
haven&#39;t measured it. So you can&#39;t see
it yet. But I know it will. Because I&#39;ve been there working with people and 
I see their pain and frustration
or whatever else. And then they build it into a product. Right. And it does pay 
off.

**Dr. McKayla** 11:23
Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. So I looked at your newest report, which was super 
interesting for me,
because it is around the software engineering teams. And there you shed light on 
the learning debt that
we have, and how that can affect engineering teams. Can you tell us a little bit 
more about what this
report is about what this software? Or what is research actually investigated? 
Or looked at? And what is
what is learning data? And why do we have it as software engineers?

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 11:56
Yeah, great question. So as a part of Catharsis&#39; work, I can occasionally 
invest in this sort of work
basically, for the field. So this is a report I did, because I found it really 
interesting, and shared publicly,
and it&#39;s called coding in the dark. I interviewed 25 software engineers or 
developers, and I asked them
to share about their active problem solving as they were ramping up on an 
unfamiliar codebase. So this
was people talking about their real jobs right now. They shared about code 
review, they shared about
how they asked for help, how they collaborated. And I&#39;ve shared a lot about, 
you know, what we talked
about. And essentially, you know, what I found was even at these really big tech 
companies, most of
the people I was talking to, we&#39;re all at big tech companies. Even at these 
places, people&#39;s experiences
were really quite frustrating. So I called this report coding in the dark, 
because that was a quote from
one of the people I interviewed, describing how they felt every day, like they 
were showing up, and the
lights were all off, you know, and that they were having to fumble their way 
through learning without any
help from anybody. And there was this core tension that they experienced between 
feeling like it was so
important to learn to build their understanding, to experiment, iterate, but 
then when they showed up,
you know, to code review, and to other moments where they were being evaluated, 
that learning was
not being valued. So I described this cycle, you know, of needing to do this 
work, and then finding it
devalued. And going back to your kind of heads down at your desk, you know, I 
describe that as
learning debt. And learning is essentially the dynamic that happens when people 
know they need to put
a lot of effort into learning. And they know that the kind of work they need to 
do requires these
mistakes. And it requires this long term understanding. And there&#39;s kind of 
all of this stuff that you&#39;re
doing that&#39;s sort of invisible, because it&#39;s not showing up in your 
productivity. And they also know that
the environment around them is only measuring that short term productivity. So 
in this kind of
environment, where there&#39;s a lot of learning, debt, accumulating, 
essentially, you know, learning you
have to be do that you&#39;re not getting rewarded for there&#39;s also a lot of 
performance, pressure, and
what&#39;s worse, you know, things like documentation, writing code, comments, 
trying to help other
people, you can actually feel actively punished for doing that. Another quote in 
the one of the interviews
I led was that learning would be seen as a waste of time. And I think one of the 
engineers called
documentation and code comments, a red flag about your abilities as an engineer. 
So you can imagine
how that feels. You&#39;re in an environment that&#39;s telling you to do all 
this complex work, but also telling
you that it&#39;s a waste of time if you help anybody else. Learn from what 
you&#39;ve learned. So, you know, a
big conclusion that I have in this report is this debt cycle this learning debt 
cycle can accumulate

damage for a long time because teams might look very productive on the surface, 
but you&#39;re building
what&#39;s really an inefficient experience for learning. So I&#39;ll stop there 
and kind of Yes, more.

**Dr. McKayla** 15:09
So yeah. Tons of question for now, the first one is really what kind of persona 
did you interview? You
were saying people that are new to a code base, but it is, are you? Did you ask 
them when they were
onboarding? And is that the onboarding experience for people? Or is that 
somebody that&#39;s already on a
team, but within you problem, it sounds more like an onboarding, experience. 
And, and, and heavy
onboarding experience. But

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 15:37
yeah, it was a mix, it was a mix. So I think that one thing that&#39;s 
interesting is that you might think, Oh,
this is somebody who&#39;s just new to a whole company, you know, they&#39;re 
experiencing the, but actually, I
found this was a repeating cycle. So some people were fairly junior, you&#39;ll 
see there&#39;s a, there&#39;s a cross
section of seniority. So we really wanted it is a qualitative project. So 
it&#39;s, it&#39;s not intended to be a
representative sample, I think, you know, follow up surveys on this kind of 
thing would be really, really
fun to work on. But in this cross section, we did have a good number of junior 
folks, but also senior
folks, even a couple people who are leading the engineering teams at their 
organization, I did ask them
to bring in an exam, think about before the interviews, when they were a recent 
problem they had of
basically trying to understand someone else&#39;s code. So if this for some 
people, this was a really brand
new codebase, right, like the whole thing as they were joining a company, but 
for some people, it was
just a piece that they hadn&#39;t really touched before. So yeah, it was 
happening really all over the place.
Right? Yeah. So the

**Dr. McKayla** 16:48
other question that I had, when I tried to envision this is, what kind of 
learning because there are many
things that are you know, that we can learn as software engineers, and I feel 
that everything that has to
do with technology is rewarded, and is seen as something, you know, that that 
you get some credit for
at least, and that it&#39;s also very internally, a lot of engineers like to 
learn new technology. But then if
you&#39;re coming to code basis, the main knowledge, right, all the work that 
you have to do to understand
this piece of code for code review, and so on, right? I can maybe relate more 
than this is the kind of
learning where would see this, you&#39;re, you&#39;re supposed to already know 
it. Right? So let&#39;s skip that step.
You know it, and then you do your productive work? And why do you you know, this 
is somehow the
invisible thing? Is that is that, you know, is my just guess, here? Is it going 
in the right direction? Or
what kind of learning? Did you? Did you investigate here?

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 17:48
Absolutely. And I love that you have called out the complexity of learning. And 
you know, it&#39;s learning is
a big word for a lot of different things. Right. And, of course, you&#39;ve had 
some really phenomenal
thinkers who have broke out on this podcast that I&#39;ve really enjoyed, 
who&#39;ve talked about, you know,
productivity is not one thing, satisfactions not one thing, the same could be 
said for learning. So, you
know, I, I thought a useful contribution in this report would be to talk very 
broadly about the beliefs we
have about learning. But the actual specific examples are a lot of different 
things. And I think it does
map on right to, to exactly what you said. So developers feel like, Oh, if 
I&#39;m learning a new language, or

a new piece of, you know, a new tool, something that&#39;s very explicit, right, 
that&#39;s easier to defend. And
it&#39;s easier to justify. But the focus is always on the technology, right? 
And the production and not so
much on, oh, now I really understand how this other team has a mental model of, 
you know, this
connection piece, or I really understand this dependency that happens. And I 
understand these trade
offs.

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 18:55
So you know, there&#39;s actually a tremendous amount of content I got in these 
interviews, that&#39;s not even
in the report, because it was so much. I think it could be another report on the 
kind of active learning
that they were doing. And a lot of it felt, you know, almost secretive, like 
people were saying, oh, you
know, I&#39;m sure no one else has to do this. Like, I do have to go back and 
remind themselves, you know,
because I don&#39;t want to talk about it, because I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t 
look like an engineer. But the reality
was, to me a lot of that stuff, like thinking about the trade offs of different 
decisions you made thinking
about whether a design decision, you know, that we put on paper really was that 
way in the code and
even questions that are kind of like, is it worth the investment to fix this 
inefficient piece when I could
instead be working on this other piece? You know, these are very abstract things 
for people to be
thinking and learning about but they&#39;re really, really critical. And I was 
reminded to, there&#39;s a lot of
myths around learning, right? And as a social scientist, I recognize some of 
these myths. So people will
tend to think, once I learned something, it&#39;s just learned forever, right? 
It just goes into like, my brain is
a bucket, and I just dumped something in there. And it&#39;s always gonna be 
there. But actually learning is
really a behavior over time. So the mourn environment cannot see it as shameful, 
but see it as beautiful
and productive and great that sometimes we&#39;re asking each other for help. 
We&#39;re reminding ourselves
how things work, you know, and you see that when developers talk about googling 
for answers, right,
and asked on Stack Overflow, and all of these other kinds of things that people 
do. But it was
interesting to me how much they hid that stuff from their environment. Yeah,

**Dr. McKayla** 20:44
yeah. Because the real engineer knows all the keyboard shortcuts.And I think 
it&#39;s so it&#39;s so true, what
you say, right? So learning what is learning? And if we are making a decision 
around trade offs, I think
very often it&#39;s not framed as learning. And then it&#39;s also how, you know 
if I can write it down. And you
know, if it&#39;s not in a book, if it&#39;s a very specific instance of 
something, another general thing that I can
learn. What does this even mean? Right? So we learn, for example, about object 
orientation, and you
know, how to how to have objects, but then to really think about this piece 
here. And the instance of
should I create an object here? And how should the object look like and that I 
have to think about that is
a little bit shameful, because, obviously, I learned object oriented 
programming. And so it should be
easily coming to me, you know, what methods I should put in here, or naming, 
right? naming a method?
Yeah, it&#39;s also learning somehow, or we have to put the time into, and then 
it&#39;s hard. And even though
we make jokes about it, if somebody sits next to you, and you have to think 
about a good name, and
only stupid names come to your mind. It&#39;s horrible.

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 22:07
Yeah, and I think you&#39;re, you&#39;re, you&#39;re pointing out something 
that&#39;s actually really, really important
here, which is, you know, there are good jokes and bad jokes, right. And 
we&#39;ve, we&#39;ve been around,
we&#39;ve all probably been around someone who has made a joke, you know, that 
has made us feel really

bad about how we learned or a mistake that we made. And this is something that 
came up in the report
to that, you know, I think one of the quotes was, I&#39;m always watching, like, 
I&#39;m from a junior code writer,
or someone said, I&#39;m always watching the senior members of my team, because 
I want to know, what
an engineer is supposed to sound like. And that can be really beneficial. If the 
people around you are
saying things like, we all make mistakes, we all forget something, you know, we 
all help each other.
That&#39;s a good learning culture. But a negative learning culture, right? A 
bad culture is a place where
people are, are saying, oh, you know, don&#39;t waste your time, like doing this 
documentation. Like in
order to get ahead, what you actually need to make sure you&#39;re doing is 
putting on this performance.
You know, things are very multifaceted, as you know, all of these things are 
always happening at once.
But I do think that there&#39;s in engineering culture, there&#39;s a lot of 
myths around what brilliance looks like.
And this is where I&#39;ve pulled from some research from people like Andre 
Symbian, who&#39;s done some
work on, you know, when a field thinks that you don&#39;t make mistakes, you 
have to just be born brilliant,
then that is a story. That is not how it works, right. But we&#39;re all kind of 
upholding that myth.

**Dr. McKayla** 23:41
Because we all want to be the 10x Engineer, right? And then we had to have 10x 
engineer. Oh, my
God. Yeah. No, but something.

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 23:51
Yeah, something that, you know, just just hurts my heart, honestly, to is is 
like, the people who people
do this work, right. People do mentor other people, they do support learning. 
And that actually is what
creates 10x results. It I mean, investing in learning is one of the most 
evidence backed ways that we
have to you need to do work together. And I had, if we could see it as something 
that we are sharing,
and that we&#39;re all working on outside of ourselves, you know, it&#39;s 
it&#39;s never about, you write bad code, I
write bad code. All right, fine. Like we work to make the code better. It&#39;s 
outside of us. And it does not
tell me who you are as an engineer. In fact, a good engineer is someone 
who&#39;s written a lot. Yeah, I
mean, we need to, you know, we need to improve things and give feedback, right. 
But I think we need
to value the messages that that feedback sends.

**Dr. McKayla** 24:47
Yeah, I think that I want to come back to this different kinds of things that we 
learn and, you know,
writing good code, whatever that means. And it&#39;s also I think, changing over 
time. What is good code,
right, whatever, what is a good way to write code but a good applications, how 
to structure them that
also evolves? But again, I would say this is this textbook knowledge, right? And 
then I think what&#39;s, and
this comes back to code reviews and to the data day to day work that we have to 
do and to productivity
a lot as well, is this constant learning? Right? I cannot stop learning. I 
cannot, you know, it&#39;s not like,
Oh, now I work. You know, obviously, you get better at this code base, and more 
familiar with the
terminology and with your, how your team works, and so on. Yes, right. But 
still, even if I&#39;m at this team
for three years, and have worked with this code base for X years, right? If I 
have a new change that
somebody else wrote, then I have to look at this code. Yeah, starts right there. 
And you know, and I
cannot come in and have this full bucket of knowledge of how that works. And 
then, you know,
supposed to already point out what was going wrong here. And maybe it has to do 
with how we
measure time, and then a lot of people I think, have really problems with time, 
I have a lot of problems
with time, like, when when should I leave the house to be on time, right? And I 
think very similar, we

estimate, for example, how long will it take to make to look at this code and 
give comments. And very
often people reduce that to the time to make the comments, but this learning 
part that is never stopping
continues and will have been added nobody wants to talk about and you know, 
nobody actually wants
to have and nobody has time for it. That&#39;s that somehow gets forgotten or is 
forgotten. Right? Yeah.
Oh, I

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 26:42
agree. I agree. And I time came up a lot in these interviews. And it doesn&#39;t 
surprise me because, you
know, we all have felt this time pressure. And what I kept asking was, you know, 
if you&#39;re experiencing
this time, pressure, like, what is the the first thing that gets cut? is, 
honestly, to me some of the most
valuable stuff, and that is really hard for people. So, you know, there is a 
sense in which I think I totally
agree that doing this work, the learning will never stop. And you&#39;ll you 
know, it can feel a little
overwhelming. But I think that that&#39;s a reason to say, you know, what 
success is not you getting to the
end of your learning. Like that&#39;s not what success is success is having 
enough space to make a good
decision instead of a bad decision about how we move forward. And I, I did see 
people go through that.
And actually, you know, I agree that it&#39;s very difficult sometimes with this 
work to predict how much time
it&#39;s going to take. And I experienced that with my own work. People ask you 
to do a research project.
And you say, okay, like, it sounds, it all sounds good. But I need to get in 
there and see what the truth
is. And we might learn, it&#39;s way more complicated. So I think about things 
like, you know, can we have
measurements of productivity, that is dynamic, that we&#39;re able to come back 
to and change it, and I
think people will get get very, very frustrated, you know, when they are 
assigned a project, they dive
into it, they do all this learning, actually mapping out how complicated it is, 
is a very valuable piece of
learning that they&#39;ve done, and they turn around and they want to share that 
with somebody, and
there&#39;s no way to share that, you know, there&#39;s no way to kind of get 
credit for it. So that&#39;s, you know,
that&#39;s one thing I think about is if we can make some of that more visible, 
right, like, like, allow you to
use the learning and share it with collaborators, I think that people really 
enjoy that they feel the
productivity of it, even if your goals of the project change. Another thing is, 
you know, can we talk about
where time pressure makes sense? And where it doesn&#39;t make sense, right? So 
can we prioritize and
and see the cost of putting everyone under a time crunch all the time? And where 
that is just creating
these learning cycles? Yeah. So

**Dr. McKayla** 29:06
what I want to understand a little bit more is, there were definitely some 
outcomes from this report, tell
us how prove right? How can we reduce these learning that how can we have this 
growth mindset?
How can we, you know, how can we in our at least in our engineering team, a 
celebrate learning and
make it a bigger priority? What are some of those outcomes? What can you suggest 
engineering teams
that want to improve their learning experience? And, and the valuing of that?

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 29:40
I think there&#39;s a piece of this puzzle for every different role, right? So, 
you know, from leaders, from
engineering leaders, these people could have a really outsized impact on the 
culture and I think that
you know, a lot of places will put a poster on the wall that says everyone could 
learn or or maybe
there&#39;s a bullet point in a slideshow about like we&#39;re alerting culture. 
But if you go to work and you see
someone actually get rewarded for a complicated learning situation like, hey, 
you know, we gave, we

told you to go try to do this thing in the codebase, it turned out the thing we, 
you know, the thing that we
proposed was not possible to do. But you did all this learning, you figured out 
a better way forward,
we&#39;re gonna celebrate that instead of, you know, coming down on somebody for 
it being not what we
expected, those kinds of moments. And I think leaders have the ability, you 
know, to, to notice that to
try to push themselves to amplify that that can have an impact. Another thing I 
would suggest, you
know, that I suggest in the report is, we honestly need to separate some of our 
development feedback
from some of our performance feedback. So okay, I don&#39;t know how many 
conversations you&#39;ve had
with engineering friends, about perf cycles. But perf cycles are a huge source 
of stress. And even
though we have invested, this is a whole area of research this ton of people, 
you know, who look at
this, but even though we have invested huge structures into it in tech 
companies, a thing that I keep
seeing as a learning scientist, is that we are rarely letting people have 
psychological safety to talk about
them learning. So I think that a very simple step that leaders could take, is to 
make space to separate
when you&#39;re talking about how you want to learn and grow and develop and 
maybe explore areas of
growth for you. And separate that from promotion, performance, reputation 
management times that you
are trying to defend yourself, which is very difficult, you know, you can&#39;t 
really do those two things. At
the same time. I have a number of other recommendations in the report, you know, 
I think that there are
some simple steps like, have we put any time in our calendar for documentation? 
Or are we just acting
like that&#39;s gonna happen magically by itself? You know, so there are small 
and big steps to try to make
yourself a learning culture. Does that all make sense?

**Dr. McKayla** 32:05
Yeah, totally. And I think documentation again, is, maybe it&#39;s the last 
thing that I want to talk a little bit
about. Because I think there again, we have these two different kind of 
learnings of information of
sharing. So you have this external documentation of how things work, right? And, 
and people agreed,
and you know, in API needs documentation, but then the nitty gritty part becomes 
a little bit translucent,
right? It&#39;s like, oh, this method, actually, you should be able to 
understand it just by looking at the code.
Otherwise, the code is not good. And don&#39;t put a comment there. That&#39;s 
really bad. Right? And I, I,
sometimes I, I really can&#39;t understand the problem here. Because while 
it&#39;s great, if you know, and there
are different learning types, and you know, in different people that maybe 
somebody is easier, you
know, it&#39;s easier for them to look at the code and really get it then skip 
the skip the comment, right? And
some people like the comment, and it gives them context. And you can really know 
in, in, you know,
native in your native language or in in, you know, in written language instead 
of code. But again, here,
there comes this the myth a little bit as well, right? We say, well, code 
shouldn&#39;t actually be
documented. And you shouldn&#39;t need documentation to read this. And there is 
also some research
around that. And they showed that if there are comments in the code, people are 
slower with reading
the code. But why? Because they are reading the comments. Right? And would they 
read the
comments if the comments are useless? No, they are reading the comments, because 
they&#39;re actually
helpful. Right? And

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 33:45
that&#39;s such a good example. Yeah, that&#39;s such a good example of a 
measure that like is taken to be a
negative measure. But why it might actually be a positive measure? Yeah. Yeah, I 
think it&#39;s, you know,
you bring so much rich lived experience on this, and I love hearing it because 
it&#39;s, the reality is that
these are going to be contextual decisions, like a code that was as you said, 
code that was good,

quote, code, quote, unquote, in one time, my deal if the context has changed, 
and then that then, you
know, you need to make a different decision. And I think that there&#39;s, 
there&#39;s there were these
interesting quotes, you know, when I interviewed people about who, who is this 
for? Is the
documentation actually, for me? Or is it for, you know, like, some idealized 
scenario where we&#39;re
describing the technology and point of view that I have in my consulting, you 
know, is that I like to focus
on people as the heart, you know, and that code writers as learners, like if we, 
if we take this approach,
where we center they&#39;re learning, we can be a lot less afraid of things like 
sometimes the trade off is
that you have more comments and that that doesn&#39;t work for all situations, 
but you have preferred did
some really deep losses in efficiency and invisible losses that are happening? 
So if someone&#39;s able to
ramp up a lot more quickly, that&#39;s a huge game. And I think something 
difficult about it is that
sometimes that gain is really invisible. But you know, it&#39;s, it&#39;s not 
really possible to have a single way of
describing code that&#39;s going to work for everyone who&#39;s ever learning. 
Yeah. And similar to measuring
developer productivity, I think it&#39;s, it&#39;s a question of what is the 
best thing for us right now. And what&#39;s
going to pay off the most, even if it slows us down a little bit in this way, 
then I think it will really pay off.
If you know, later, this person who we gave all the support to is able to become 
this champion
contributor. And I just think, you know, I use the learning debt cycle, like the 
learning debt metaphor to,
to evoke tech debt, because we understand tech debt right in this field. And we 
understand that
technologies with all these dependencies can start to break apart, even if it 
made sense when we built
it. And I think the same is true for collaboration. Yeah,

**Dr. McKayla** 36:11
Yeah. Yeah, there&#39;s so much goodness in that. And I really want to dig into 
the productivity. So maybe
what I want to do is I&#39;m going to invite your again, a whole episode just on 
productivity if you&#39;re up for it.
Yeah. And then we can really dissect that, because I would love to hear your, 
your opinion also on, you
know, you mentioned or hinted a little bit towards that. Can we measure learning 
as part of our
productivity? Right. And I had a podcast where was just me talking about 
productivity. And there, I was
asking the question, I was saying that all these productivity measure that we 
have focused around
activity, right, coming from an area of the industrial age, right, where, well, 
it was the activity that better
Yeah, exactly. And it was that the activity that we did, right, you had only to 
do very mechanical tasks,
and the small task, and so you could count them, and so on. And all those 
measurements actually stem
from there. And now we put them on knowledge workers, were probably the most 
productive thing is
that I&#39;m sitting here doing nothing, but I make a really good trade off this 
session. Right? That&#39;s right,

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 37:21
that&#39;s right, or you help someone else and they do something, I would love 
to have that conversation.
And I do think there are ways we can measure learning. And you know, if anyone 
is going to be
listening to this, like, go to your team right now and ask, what are the things 
that we do that really make
a difference, that are not being captured anywhere that are not being rewarded? 
Like what is the stuff
that you know, is important to do to keep this all of this running? And they 
will tell you?

**Dr. McKayla** 37:53
Yeah, yeah. And coming back to what you say, with the sharing, I think what I 
have seen work really
well is small things like brown bags, right? Where we come together, and 
somebody just explains what
they have learned this week. Or if you go back to code reviews, right, that you 
that every Friday, for

example, that&#39;s happening on GitHub every Friday, they are sharing, and 
sometimes they are sharing,
what did I learn this code review? That was really excellent. Right? You know, 
it&#39;s a comment that, uh,
no person really took the time and gave me great comment. Or I&#39;m showing 
some code that I have
seen that I haven&#39;t seen before, or, you know, some some Yeah, paradigm or 
something that I&#39;ve seen.
So and we are sharing, we&#39;re making some of those very implicit things that 
are internal that are not,
we are making them explicit and sharing them. And I think this is a celebration, 
as you said, I think
those are themes can maybe do to celebrate what&#39;s also often referred to as 
blue work, right? Oh, this,
this colleague helped me or that person, you know, they didn&#39;t work on their 
ticket, which had them for
their promotion, but they actually went out of their way and did this and that, 
right. And so, we open
openly sharing this and making it explicit. And I think, especially in our 
remote world now is more
important, right, that we have shared that somehow. Yeah, no, I

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 39:16
think that that&#39;s a beautiful point. And really, really important. And, and 
something that I also thought,
you know, something again, that people people said in the interviews, which was, 
I want to see specific
examples. I want to sit next to somebody and see them, see them code, you know, 
and, and that just I
think people don&#39;t know how much that doesn&#39;t happen. I think they 
assume it&#39;s happening or they say,
oh, go get coffee, you know, with this person who wrote the code, you&#39;ll, 
you know, go talk to them. But
people often struggle, especially if you&#39;re remote, you know, if you&#39;re 
new person, there&#39;s all kinds of
ways in which people you know, reasons that people might not ask for help. And 
as I told you, I started
out my career looking at Three and five year olds and in classrooms and when 
they ask for help, and
even when we are four and five years old, we&#39;re looking at the people around 
us. And we&#39;re asking,
Can I Can I ask for help? Can I talk to you about my real learning? So that 
continues? And the more
you see those small messages, and those small social moments can just have a 
huge impact.

**Dr. McKayla** 40:23
Yeah, yeah. And I think team culture and psychological safety, and all of that 
is so important. And it&#39;s,
it&#39;s, it&#39;s not something that you can just fix by doing three things 
today, right? It&#39;s something that you
can start. But it&#39;s a continuous process. And I think this is one of those 
very rewarding things and you
know, things that pay off, but are a little bit invisible, that you have to 
constantly work on that right, and
that you have to raise the bar and say, we are actually allowed to have 
questions be wrong, you know,
growth mindset, and I think it&#39;s really, it&#39;s a continuous work in a 
team, but the teams that managed to
do it, they are so much better off than That&#39;s right.

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 41:07
And it just is a beautiful part of it, you know, I try to make these problems 
easier for myself, and for
other people by saying, who&#39;s already doing this, right? Like, how do we 
give them a stage to do it?
Like, you&#39;re who&#39;s the person that someone always everybody goes to this 
person to ask for help? You
know, how do we make sure that they are instead of being like, burdened by this 
invisible work, they&#39;re
actually rewarded for all this support that they&#39;re doing? Yeah.

**Dr. McKayla** 41:34
Yeah, that&#39;s so true. Well, it kinda, it actually brings us to the end of 
this show. I said, I&#39;m going to bring
you back. If you have time. I will continue. We can continue this discussion a 
little bit more. But is there

anything that you want to tell my listeners, maybe that you think, you know, 
wraps up some of the
learnings that would be powerful for them for the software engineering teams? 
How can they, you
know, be in a better place? What are what is the one advice, you know, that you 
would give them?

**Dr. Cat Hicks** 42:08
Yeah, great question. How, what a lovely question to be asked, you know, I think 
I end the report that I
recently released, saying, learning matters. And I would I would like to leave 
with that, which is that, you
know, learning matters and measurement matters. Like whenever we measure 
something, I think, Who
is this measurement for? And is it bringing us closer to this culture that we 
want to have, you know,
where we feel free and happy and, and like, we&#39;re all learning together, 
which is what we need in order
to tackle these huge, complicated problems in the world, you know, we need to 
get past some of these
myths about where brilliance comes from, and the myths that we all need to hide, 
you know, are
learning from each other. But that people will only be able to do that if we 
make the environment around
them safe. You know, so it kind of comes from both sides from from us building 
the environment as
individuals in it, but also from people who are able to kind of say, well, 
I&#39;m gonna, I&#39;m going to do
something to make this environment safer. So that&#39;s what I would say, you 
know, learning matters, it
pays off. Let&#39;s let&#39;s work for it.

**Dr. McKayla** 43:18
Yeah, that&#39;s beautiful. That&#39;s really great. So thank you so much cat 
for being on my show. And I will
definitely ping you again and ask you for more of your input. Thank you so much. 
Okay. Bye bye.
