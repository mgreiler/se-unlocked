[00:00:00] **Michaela:** Hello and welcome to the Software Engineering Unlocked 
Podcast. I'm your host, Dr. Michaela, and today I have the pleasure to talk to 
Heather Reid, a test engineer about her latest job search. 

But before I start, let me tell you a little bit about my latest project 
awesomecodereviews.com. All my work on code reviews has now its own dedicated 
home. At awesomecodereviews.com, you'll find articles about code review 
practices, code review checklists, news about the latest research about code 
reviews, and of course workshops and courses I offer around this topic. So 
please hop over to awesomecodereviews.com and check out my latest work.

But now back to Heather. Heather is a test engineer at Glofox.

Before that, she was the community boss for Ministry of Testing, making sure 
that the testing community had everything to be striving. Before that, she was a 
software tester at Exploristics, and at Moola. Although Heather had been active 
in the testing community for over a decade, when she was searching for a new 
role, she heard she wasn't the tester and that she has been gone too long.

I want to talk with her about her latest job search. So Heather, welcome to the 
show. 

[00:01:13] **Heather:** Thank you so much for having me. 

[00:01:16] **Michaela:** Yeah, so we met like met online, met, when I was 
actually applying for giving a talk at Ministry of Testing, I think. That was the 
first time that we somehow got into contact, was a little bit before the pandemic 
and then we never met because the pandemic came and we didn't go there, like to 
the Ministry of Testing thing.

[00:01:35] **Heather:** Yeah, yeah.

[00:01:36] **Michaela:** Right, the test batch. So yeah, but I'm really happy 
to have you here. And so, well, because of that, I'm following you on 
Twitter and I'm reading, you know, a little bit what you're writing and I saw 
you write this blog post about your, like, like this latest job search that at 
one point you were very convinced that it's true:

"I have been out of the testing game". 

[00:01:57] **Heather** Yes. 

[00:01:58] **Michaela** And, and it's really hard to get a 
job now. So how, how did that come? 

[00:02:00] **Heather:** Um, So yeah, I suppose why I started searching for a job 
was I, I started with Ministry of Testing to, to work on our community platform, 
the club. And I started writing code for that and I realized, oh, I miss this so 
much and like testing my changes and everything.

And I started, I started to think then that maybe, maybe I, I wanted to get back 
into a role where I was doing much more testing every day than I was getting
the chance to with Ministry of Testing because there, there was so much to do. 
It was, it was a really exciting job. There was, there was so much that you, 
that you could do in it.

But I wanted, I wanted to pivot more back to, to the testing side of things. So 
I started to apply to different companies. Some people rejected me as soon as 
they saw my CV, but just they saw Ministry of Testing, community boss. All 
right. Well, you haven't been a tester for, for five years, so no. A couple of 
other companies, then I went through the interview process with them and had some--

[00:03:18] **Michaela:** So can we, can we, tell maybe a little bit what a 
Community Boss does because yeah, I know it, you know it, but maybe you know, 
my listeners don't know. So they said you have been a community boss at 
Ministry of Testing for five years.

Ministry of Testing is one of the largest testing communities, right? Maybe. I 
dunno. And so you had a community boss there. What were your 
responsibilities? What did you do all day as a community boss that you are so 
out of testing and you know, far away from the industry?

[00:03:44] **Heather:** Yeah, that's a, it's a, that's a good 
point actually, 'cause one of my previous roles was a, a mathematical planner, 
which was the job title for, for a software developer. 

Cause I just seem to, I, I seem to live in vague job 
title land a lot of the time. So yeah, the community boss I was involved in 
organizing the conferences that we ran around the world each year. So we used 
to run seven conferences around the globe each year. I also helped out with our 
social media platforms, making sure that things were getting shared both our 
content and content from people in the community.

I, so as part of the, the organizing of the events, I used to listen to 
podcasts, watch people's YouTube channels, read their blogs, to, to get a good, a 
good feel for people in the community. So looking for people who could give a 
talk, maybe online, not quite at the conference as part of the conferences, then 
I would--

I would make a point of reviewing every single abstract that we received for a 
conference to give people feedback. Now that might sound like, well, obviously 
you should do that, but for some of the events, we were getting four or 500 
abstracts submitted for them, and we had a maximum of 10 places.

So, the, the ratio of, of submissions to acceptances, was, it was never going to be 
huge. But because of that I wanted to make sure that everyone who submitted 
received feedback from us as to why, how they could make it better. How, how to 
push themselves into the top 20 shortlist for future, for example, up. What, 
what else did I do?

I did, I moderated online communities, so a lot of that as well is in 
the background. So a lot of what the community boss did was kind of in the 
shadows. So I was keeping an eye on our Slack channels, our, our 
other discussion forums. If we had an online event. I was watching the chat 
stream.

Making sure that people were adhering to our code of conduct. And if 
they weren't, then again, taking action behind the scenes for that. So 
yeah, a lot.

[00:06:14] **Michaela:** Yeah, a lot. A lot. And I definitely didn't hear that 
you were testing, so probably, right, right. So you're not actively testing. But 
on the other hand, what comes to my mind is like software testing. 

I would say its almost like riding a bicycle. I don't know. Like I would say it's 
like that, like if you know how to test software, it's really hard to forget. I don't know, 
maybe you can't forget. Maybe you forget it. In five years, did you forget how 
to test software in five years?

[00:06:39] **Heather:** Definitely not, given, given the experience I've 
had in the job so far.

I definitely haven't I, yeah, I think, I think to an extent, 
writing code is similar. Like you'll come, like if you took a break and you come 
back. You'll be able to start writing code. It might not be super perfect. 
There'll be a couple of nuances that you'll have forgotten, but you'll, 
you'll manage to, to use your riding a bike analogy, you'll manage to get up on 
the bike and, and pedal for a little bit, but your balance might be off, but 
you'll keep practicing and practicing and, and you'll, you'll get ack.

[00:07:17] **Michaela:** Yeah. I also think that if you read, you know, 
abstracts of, you know, what people will give talks at the conference, if you 
read blog posts to be, you know, informed what the community thinks. You 
actually know a lot about testing. I mean, these are, this is if you would 
be on a testing job, well then you would do testing, but then in addition, if 
you would be reading those articles, you would definitely advance your career.

Right. So, how, how did you feel about it? Did you feel that you actually 
know quite what's going on in the testing community? Maybe even better as 
somebody that just tests and doesn't read any articles or sees any, you know, 
conference talks. I mean, you were right there with the latest and greatest, right?

[00:07:57] **Heather:** Yeah. Yeah. And as part of that as well, I, I used to, at the, 
at the in-person conferences, I used to sit in on some of the workshops as well. 
Maybe even take part in some of them. And that went as well when we moved to online 
because of the pandemic. Then we started to do 99 minute workshops, mm-hmm. on online.

So you could attend online and you could, you could learn a key skill in 99 
minutes. So as, as part of the, the moderating and all that sort of stuff. I 
used to attend those workshops and I used to, So I there's one that sticks out 
in my mind of like, of, of, of Git skills, so how to, So I was trying to 
refresh my memory and how to use git.

So I attended one of those. There was a, an SQL workshop, an accessibility 
workshop. So I was attending all of these and I was doing and learning with 
people who were in, in the community. So while I didn't necessarily have a 
product that I could practice it all on. I was, I was still trying to stay up to 
date with it all. 

[00:09:13] **Michaela:** So you told us that there were some desk rejects, 
right? People just saw Ucv. Yeah. Oh, community boss. That's not the tester. So 
Yeah, we are not inviting her. And then some people invited you. So what 
happened with these interviews when they invited, 

[00:09:27] **Heather:** Yeah. So I had a couple, So one one of the first 
interviews that I did where it was, I think the interview was nearly four hours 
long, and I came out of it and I was exhausted.

I think it was only meant to be an hour or an hour and a half, but it was this 
whole like, we're going to pair an ensemble. I'm gonna give you this, I'm gonna 
give you this exercise to do, and then we're gonna go through your. Get 
repositories and we're going to go through all your previous blogs. And it was, 
it was really intense, but I was successful.

And that was the first one. And I kind of went, "Oh, maybe I can do this". And 
then they said, "Oh, sorry, actually you're based in Ireland. Oh, we can't hire 
from Ireland". And I was, "No. Cool. Okay. Thank you..." So there was that, that 
the initial, it was like, Woo, brilliant. And then I had, I had a couple of 
other interviews, so one where I did, so they'd read my CV, I had a couple of 
half hour interviews and everything was looking really good.

They were apparently very impressed with me. and, and then I got a rejection and 
it was like, Oh, well, you know, based on the interviews we've had with you so 
far, you couldn't make an impact in the first week in your job. And we need 
someone who can do that. And I was kind of, I, I was really hurt when I first 
heard it.

I was like, Oh my God. But as I spoke to people in the community, they were 
like, nobody will make an impact in their first week in a new job. That's 
outrageous to assume, but it, the doubt starts to creep in. And then mm-hmm. 
interviewed with a couple of other companies and maybe did the first round and 
they'd said, "Oh, if, why do you want to get back into testing?"

I said, "Well, I've, I've never left. But Okay." Well, I, I miss hands on testing 
and, you know, I've been practicing. Well, you know, practicing isn't the real. 
Oh, okay. And then there was a couple where it was just question after question 
after question from the interviewer, and they were asking me, "Oh, what if you 
are in this scenario, how would you test this?"

And I started asking questions for context, because as testers, that's what we 
do. You, we don't just get a product and start testing. You're starting to ask, 
Well, what do our customers want? Okay. And. For what risks have you seen? So 
you're starting to build a picture of mm-hmm. Okay. Well if they've already 
identified these risks, but I've identified these where, where can we take this 
when we're testing and I got back, "Well, you can't ask questions."

"Sorry. No, you just have to go with this and test this. You can't ask." And as each 
of, as these bad interviews for want of a better phrase, build up, and 
they're, they start getting more and more negative. You start doubting yourself. 
You start thinking, "I can't do this. I can't get back into testing, and I, I 
don't know this."

And they're, they're all right. And why should I even be trying? And it was 
really hard, but. Lots of people in the community were supporting me because 
they, they knew that I was passionate. They knew that I, that I could do this. 
And the, the company that I'm now with, it was, it was a, a chance encounter 
where I got a message asking, Oh, how are things going?

I'm, I mean, I'm interviewing for some jobs and, and Hugh, who is my manager now 
at Glofox, he said, "Oh, you're, you're interviewing." And I said, "Yeah, I just, 
I wanna get back into, into software testing." And he says, "Oh, we have an open 
role. Would you like to apply now? He said, Because I know you, I'm gonna stay 
as much outta this process as possible."

"I'm gonna let our other managers, whatever interview you. But I really, really 
think that you would be a perfect fit for our company." And I was like, "Oh yeah, 
here we go." Another one saying, You'll be perfect because you know people from 
the community and they're, that's all, they're only interested in me because 
like it's, I could help them with connections or something, which is, which is 
what had happened with previous roles.

So I was entering it with a negative mindset, I suppose. Mm-hmm. But my first 
interview was, One of the directors of engineering who I'd never met and, and 
the, the the guy who would go on to be my team lead and they. We were able to 
ask like really frank, honest questions to each other, and I felt so excited.

Like I, I, I genuinely asked them. Cause at this point I was like, I have 
nothing to lose. I've had so many bad interviews, Let's just roll with it. I 
said, "Okay. In your opinion, what's the biggest mistake this company has ever 
made?" And, and they said, "Hmm, okay. That's a good. Well, I think one of our 
biggest mistakes was not having testers in, in the beginning."

"We did two years without it and we've spent years paying it back. "So they were, 
they were both pretty well aligned on that. And I said, I asked them "what does a 
bad day in your job look like?" And the director of engineering said "Well, if 
there is an outage that goes on for a prolonged period of time", he said, "That's 
a bad day in my job because customers are, are gonna start losing faith in our 
business."

"And we, we pride ourselves in very like low amounts of downtime. And the team 
lead said for him a bad day in his job was receiv. A notice that someone wanted 
to quit because he said if, if he'd had no indication before this, that that was 
going to happen, that then to him, it felt like he wasn't doing a good job as a 
team lead."

Mm-hmm. If he, if he didn't see it coming, he felt like he'd somehow let this 
person or the team. and I really loved that honesty. It's like, this is great. I 
got to ask questions and I got really honest answers back. This is fabulous. And 
so my total interview process, I had the first interview with the, the team lead 
and the director of engineering, and then I had an interview with one of the 
testers on the team.

And the, the test manager, and again, I got to ask like some really frank 
questions and the cto, and again, I, I was, I was really happy with how honest 
he was with the answers to the questions. There was no holding back. There was 
no, Oh yeah. We're a fabulous place to work. It was, you know, we're trying 
really.

There, there are a few places where we could improve. An example of that is 
this. So, you know, make your own decisions based on that, Heather, we're not 
going to sell you something that we're not. And I thought that was so refreshing 
And yeah, honestly, it's. The role so far has lived up to the expectations that 
those people set and more so I was definitely not sold something fake

[00:17:24] **Michaela:** And so it sounds very intense. So there was the, the 
director, there was the cto mm-hmm. The CEO and another. 

[00:17:32] **Heather:** Tester, right? Or so Yeah. The, the first one was, The 
director of engineering and the team lead, and then there was a tester and the 
test team lead and then the cto and I was meant to have one with the CEO.

Mm-hmm. But at the time that I was interviewing he was, he was trying to 
secure series B funding, so he sent his apologies and said, Look, everyone's so, 
Has sung your praises? I am. I am completely happy to, to offer you a role. And 
then once I started, there was I think four other people who started around the 
same time as me, and he arranged a meeting then with all four of us to welcome 
us to the company and talked through his visions and everything.

So while we didn't get the one-to-one interview, we got a very intimate setting, 
I suppose you'd call it with the ceo, which. You don't always get at a company 
which is 200 or 250 people in size. And again, That's true. Yeah. I thought that 
was really nice. Yeah. 

[00:18:39] **Michaela:** And so when you had this interview, you felt that the 
company was very honest, but also what, what about your skills?

Did you feel that you now. Somehow are at test or did you, you know, how, how 
does that, because over the, the last interviews, you got this feeling that I'm 
maybe too far gone or, you know, Yeah. My skills are, aren't good enough or 
something. So how did that, how did that interview make you feel? 

[00:19:04] **Heather:** So between the first two interviews, I got a, a 
technical test.

Which was when they said technical test, I panicked. It's like, I don't have the 
skills for this. Why are you giving me this? But the company has a really strong 
focus on exploratory testing. So they gave me a test product and they were 
really. They really hammered home time box this, We don't expect you to spend 
hours and weeks on this.

Mm-hmm. time Box your investigation into this and based on your investigation, 
write a short report of the risks you saw or the approaches you would take to 
testing. And at the time I had a seven month old. So I, time boxing was perfect 
for me because I didn't have a lot of time to spend. So I sat down at the 
computer and I said, "Right, I'm giving myself two hours, absolute max, but I'd 
like to spend less than two hours."

And I wrote all this in the report I wrote, mm-hmm, time spent initially 
exploring the product, like seeing what it does, 15 minutes. Issues to come back 
to that I identified while doing this. These time spent writing or time spent 
writing a couple of charters or ideas to explore this. And based on that, here 
is my report, which I spent this long writing.

And so once I was successful, I got, I got feedback from the team lead of. The, 
the mobile team, which I ended up being placed in and from the test team lead 
that, that, that was exactly what they wanted to see. They'd seen so many people 
who had spent 5, 6, 7 hours weeks on this writing, like really detailed reports, 
and that's, that's not what they wanted.

And they had made that clear in the instructions. We we're just using this to 
see how you would approach testing. Mm-hmm. It's like, it's not our product , so 
you don't, you don't need to be putting this much time into it. And they do, 
they value the, the work life balance. And the team lead had said to me a after, 
when I was hired, he said, "In all the years I am interviewing people, you are 
the best interview that I have ever done."

And I was like, "Nice. Really?" Like I, Cause sometimes be 
can be quite sarcastic. Um, And I said, "Oh, you're, you're joking, right? 
Because, you know, I'm a tester and you are a developer." He goes, "No, Heather, 
I'm serious." Because he rounded out the, the, the interview with the question. 
"If I gave you a budget of, I think it was something like 123 Euros and 57 pens 
for it was a very specific number."

"And I said to you, I wanted to organize a team activity. How would you spend 
that money?" And I said, "Well, it de-- it depends what you're hoping for from your 
team. So, Is your team very well connected? Is this a team building exercise? Do 
you think they need to work on their communications? If so, something like maybe 
an escape room could be fun."

"Have they had like a super intense delivery period? If it's that, then maybe 
something like a group gaming session where they can just relax. Or depending on 
if there's just two people on your team and they've worked maybe a lot of 
overtime in the past while, divide that equally between them and send them a 
voucher to, to go and have a meal with someone to get a break."

Yeah. And he was, he said, "You know, this is the amount of people who just turn 
around and go, 'I'd buy pizza and beers for everyone'."

[00:23:17] **Michaela:** Yeah. And I think this is also showing too, that even 
though you're maybe not directly working exactly in that role, that you're, you 
know, are going to now work, you are acquiring so many new skills, right? So 
yeah. I mean, if you are a tester for five years, And then a tester for 10 
years. I really wonder, can you, no.

No, is there such a big difference between a tester that you know into it for 
five years, for seven years or for 10 years? Or maybe you know, a person that 
sees something else that learns something else? Different skills, right? Being 
in a different environment. And then it's not that you have been a nurse, right?

You're still in the testing. You know, In the testing, environment. But suddenly 
you have really different skill sets to learn and you bring that actually as a 
very as a bonus. I think if we are all, we all want people to, you know, think 
out of the box and, you know, be openminded and be, you know, have. Initiative 
and inspiration and whatnot.

Right. But then we want them to do the same things for 25 years. Right. don't 
change anything in your current path, right? Yep. Just be a tester and you know, 
be it from day one until you die . Yeah. Which makes no sense to be right. So 
you're actually bringing a lot of different. Different skills and different 
perspectives, and I think perspectives are extremely important for a tester.

Right? Having different perspectives and knowing actually this product could be 
maybe used differently. Or. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I could attempt to do this 
with that product and so on. Right. So this is actually a, a great-- 

[00:24:53] **Heather:** Benefit I think. Yeah, definitely. 

[00:24:56] **Michaela:** Yeah, so it was definitely nice to hear that, right? To 
hear suddenly somebody being, and, and I think probably not only hearing it 
after the fact, I think you can sense it, you can sense that the person is 
generally happy with how you perform at, you know, at the interview and even 
more, I would argue that you can sense what they think about you in the first 
seconds.

And this last whole, you know, interview, if they look at you and they, they 
think right secretly, maybe even unconsciously. Oh, Heather, The 'not tester'. 
Yeah. You know, the person far gone. 

[00:25:33] **Heather:** You know, the, the, the, the--

[00:25:36] **Michaela:** Ccareer switcher. Yeah. They will perform a very 
different interview than, you know, the person that comes in and sees Heather.

Yeah, you know, Heather who wants to be a tester here and has experience in the 
testing community and, and a lot of experience and very valuable experience, 
right? They will ask different questions. They will integrate your answers very 
differently, right? And probably you also perform differently because you feel 
how they.

Respond to your--

[00:26:04] **Heather:** you know. Yeah. You feel like there are people that you 
could work with. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

[00:26:11] **Michaela:** I interviewed once for Google and, and interview 
started off me and the person interviewing me, arguing whether I'm interviewing 
for the software engineering position or the pro-- product manager.

Oh, 

[00:26:26] **Heather:** That's a great start.

[00:26:28] **Michaela:** Yeah. Right. And I said, "I'm here for the software 
engineering position." And he says, "No, you're here for the product manager." And 
I'm "No." Go back, back and forth. And you know, you can--

[00:26:39] **Heather:** --imagine how that went.

Yeah, 

[00:26:46] **Michaela:** It was just downhill after that.

[00:26:50] **Heather:** Yeah. Yeah. I do, I do wonder sometimes, like, cuz I've, 
I've heard of a, one of my colleagues who went from being a test manager back to 
being a tester and she talks about her quitting criteria for an interview. Mm. 
So at one point in it when she was interviewing to get to get back "air quotes" into 
testing she, she said, at one point in an interview.

She just said, "I'm sorry, it's, let's just call it a day here. I'm, I'm not 
proceeding with this interview." And I kind of thought, Wow. Massive respect for 
doing that in the middle of an interview because like that, like you, you sat 
through that interview. I, after having that experience, when you already 
probably had a good feeling that like they had to, they would've had to wow you.

At that point to make go for them. I mean, I was 

[00:27:48] **Michaela:** writing algorithms 

[00:27:50] **Heather:** in Google Docs. Yeah. Which was the most horrible 
experience 

[00:27:55] **Michaela:** ever with this guy that didn't believe I can be a 
software engineer. So, you know, it was just done 

[00:28:00] **Heather:** from the beginning. 

[00:28:01] **Michaela:** Like, there, there one, no, there was no path to 
success.

[00:28:06] **Heather:** Yeah,

[00:28:08] **Michaela:** It was already close and, and I did it right. I should 
have said, Well, you. If I, because he's probably not even prepared to do an SDE 
interview, right? Yeah. Like he's prepared to do a different kind of interview 
and then we do this, you know I don't know, string search, 

[00:28:23] **Heather:** thing in Google Docs, which, 

[00:28:25] **Michaela:** or I, I can't remember what was some of those very.

Traditional Yeah. You know, coding past things where you traver in Google Docs 
thingy, right? Well anyway. Yeah. So cool. So then you got this job, but there's 
still something in between that we are not talking about. This project that 
you're doing right. 

[00:28:46] **Heather:** Mm. The, the projects that I'm doing in work.

Yeah. The many projects. Yeah. I've, I've I have nearly too many projects now. 
Yeah. . 

[00:28:56] **Michaela:** So why are you doing those and what are those projects 
and what would you recommend others? 

[00:29:02] **Heather:** Yeah. So I suppose when, when I was starting into the 
job, I. I had been speaking to a career coach at the mm-hmm. at, before I 
started, and I was kind of like, Mm, yeah, maybe we'll do it.

We'll see. Because I was still doubting myself that I could do anything. And 
then when I signed the contract for Glo Fox, I thought, Do you know what? 
That's, let's just do this, let's do this career coaching. So in addition to a 
full-time job and. Being a mom, I, I started the career coaching in the evenings 
and, and working on some small side projects to kind of, to really harness 
skills that I already had, but in a, in a productive way mm-hmm.

So getting a website set up, writing blogs about my experience because when I 
look back at my career. For me, a blog is a very good personal diary, but 
that's public. So how did I handle that situation in the past? So the blog post 
that you mentioned at the start of Yeah. The, this podcast is an example o of of 
that.

It's like a writing a letter to my future self of if you ever doubt your 
abilities. Know that you are excellent. So so yeah, in, in work then I have a, a 
lot of, a lot of projects kind of spinning that I de I decided I wanted to do 
myself. So while we can test the product that we're working on, there's many 
other ways that testers can have a positive impact in their organiz.

So two examples of of projects that I'm working on are, are trying to get the 
bug backlog down in our, in our team. And sometimes that means, Okay, well 
here's a bug that's four years old. Clearly nobody is going to do anything 
about. or can it even be reproduced? Like is it on such an old version of the 
software that that section just doesn't exist anymore?

But then there's others and it's, and it's trying to encourage the team to, to 
tackle them. Because I believe as a tester that if, if customers are continually 
reporting the same bugs, that presents a really bad image of the. To that 
customer. Mm-hmm. like, it's like, well, you're not even gonna action this.

So if I wanted a new feature, like, are you even going to consider that? And, 
and that's, that's my mindset as a user of, of products where bugs aren't 
actioned. So I work, I'm working on getting that tackled, but a super, a super 
secret project, , that the team worked. Recently was trying to build 
accessibility into our role by labs because I, I'm a huge accessibility 
advocate.

I, I believe that everything. It should be as accessible as it possibly can be. 
Does that mean that everybody would be able to use it? Not necessarily. So I'm 
thinking here, you know, like mountain biking trails as an example. Mm-hmm. 
like, not everyone can use them, but they can, they can be accessible to, to 
some people who aren't, you know, 20 somethings with, with kick ass bites.

So the accessibility project was on top of all of the other things we were 
doing, bringing new features into the product, this bold backlog. Some other 
like projects like trying to build an automation, a bigger automation suite for 
the product and it. It's been so rewarding. Um, It's, it start, it started off 
with the kind of the team maybe saying, Yeah, we need to build accessibility in, 
but I mean, we dunno where to start.

I said, "Well, I don't exactly know where to start either, but if we agree to do 
this together, you never know. Like what we could." And so we, in the 
organization, the way we work is we slice down features which means that we're 
delivering, When we're delivering, we're delivering the smallest piece of 
something that delivers value to the customer.

Mm-hmm. And by, it's not quite MVP land, it's more. Value and risk. So by 
delivering the smallest thing possible, we're re, we're trying to reduce 
business and technical risk. So we're not gonna over-engineer a whole new 
database, for example. We're gonna see what we can do maybe with the existing 
functionality we have, and then slowly build upon that as we get feedback.

Mm-hmm. From our customers. So with the accessibility project we, we sliced it 
down to the smallest possible paths through the app and we decided to just focus 
on the screen reader journey because if we started to play around with color 
contrasts or things like that, our users would start to notice mm-hmm.

and we didn't quite want them to notice when we were still trying to figure this 
all out. So we started with the, with the screen reader journey, and we sliced 
that down as small as possible. So it was like a user will be able to log in 
using a screen reader, a user will be able to search for a class using a screen 
reader.

And we, we, we broke it all down like that incrementally so that each, at each 
step of the way we were delivering value to somebody. Mm-hmm. And so this, 
this is a, this is a long way of saying that, when you, or if you are thinking 
of getting back into software testing or software engineering or whatever 
industry you feel like you've been out of for a while, but you like to get back 
to don't necessarily feel intimidated by people's blogs and YouTube channels and 
everything, talking about all of the amazing things.

They're doing because that can seem super daunting and, and similar with the job 
search. There's so many things to do with the job search, but if you slice it 
down like we did with the projects or how we do with features into the smallest 
possible thing that can deliver value to you as an individual, and you have.

A metric, I hate using the term, but you have, you have something that you can 
say, Yes, this slice of the thing was a success. So for example, I am going to 
write one paragraph of an introduction for a cover letter. So your success 
metric is you have a paragraph that introduces you on your cover letter.

Yeah. And that it, that, that then helps you to tackle it. Trying to get back 
into a new industry or what, what can seem like it's a new industry? It can be, 
it can be, it can feel massive. It can be terrifying. Yeah. But if you break it 
down to smaller, to smaller winds, then you're getting a little win along the 
way.

[00:36:56] **Michaela:** And I, I actually think like, how long have you now 
been at the--

[00:37:00] **Heather:** --blue? Six months. 

[00:37:01] **Michaela:** Six months. And you talked about so many things that 
you're already impacting there. I actually think that there's, it's a little bit 
imprinted in your mind. You can't have impact. Yeah. Even though he said within 
the first week, like you're like, I can have impact, you know?

Yeah. And I think you are definitely showing, right? And you're proving people 
wrong, which. I don't think it's necessary. Right. But obviously it feels very 
good for yourself and for your self-esteem, Right. To say, Yeah. Wow, you all 
really missed out on an amazing person, you know? Yes. That you're completely 
underestimated, right?

[00:37:36] **Heather:** Yeah. Yeah. And that it was something I, I talked to my 
boss about last week before I published a blog post because I said, You know, 
I'm writing this, this blog, and it's like the, the vibe of it is you. A letter 
to everyone who said, I couldn't do this, and here's the impact I've made in, in 
my first, I said, I'd break it down and just do the first three months.

And he said, "You don't, you don't need to do that. Like in the company, we're 
all seeing the impact that you're having". I said, "I know I don't need to from a 
company perspective, but I want to from from a perspective of near." Reminded 
myself that I could do it. Yeah. Because my career coach said to me when I 
started the job, create a document at Google Docs, and he said, And every time 
you have a small win, so, oh, for, I, I wrote one automation test today and I 
haven't written one in six years, for example, he said, Write that down.

That's a. And he said, When you get to your six month review, open that Google 
Doc in front of your team lead because they're going to, they're, they're going 
to know obviously the impact that I've had so far, as you mentioned. But he 
said, when you open that Google Doc and you scroll for pages and pages of the 
wins you've had, Big and small.

He said that's like, that's hard evidence that you were excellent at what you 
do. Yeah. And I thought it was really vain when he first said it, but now I'm 
looking at it and I'm like, Oh, I can do this. I can actually, I can really have 
an 

[00:39:17] **Michaela:** impact. And I think, I was actually talking with 
Michael Lynch for his podcast, and he has something that's called.

What I, what I have done or something, right? Mm-hmm. There were also startups 
got this done or something like this, and it's very similar, right? That it's 
it's a memory of what I have actually accomplished. And I think it's so, so 
important for career advancement because we, we assume the team lead will.

But you don't know what you have done the last three months because you will 
forget, right? Yeah. You will know a couple of things, maybe seven, because 
that's somehow what we can keep in mind, right? Yes. Yep. But you probably have 
done, I don't know, 70, right? And so having this document and really looking 
through it will refresh your memory and this will be so important for your, you 
know, advancement of your career in that company.

Yeah. But something else I think, and, and this is, you know, reminds me what 
you said at the beginning, the community boss, that that did a lot of things 
behind the scenes. Yeah, and also in companies, we are doing a lot of things 
behind the scenes, and so when I, for example, left Microsoft, I thought about 
all these things that have been done inside Microsoft and that people knew 
inside Microsoft, but the world didn't know about it.

Right? Yeah. It's like the only thing I was left was that I could put one line 
on my CV saying, Oh, I have been at Microsoft from this to that date, and maybe 
have a small paragraph of what I. What I've done. It's tiny, right? Yeah. Would 
I have done a block? Right. And driving, let's say every three months.

Yeah. You know, a summary of the main things that you have accomplished. Then 
that's a document not only for internally advancing your career, but also 
externally. So I think what you're doing right now, right, with writing that 
down, and you don't have to publish every week a blog post, but you know, 
occasionally writing something about what you.

Helps you also with your career outside, because you never know, right? Maybe 
you want to, you know, maybe they let people go or you know, you want to change 
at one point, and also to establish your value inside the company. So I think 
blogging and having a blog, even if it's a simple, you know, Red Press blog, 
blog or something right, is so, so important.

[00:41:32] **Heather:** Well, yeah, I completely over-engineered mine and I went 
into like, Oh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do this myself, but . But again, it was kind 
of one of those things of just to prove that I could do it. Yeah, 

[00:41:46] **Michaela:** Yeah, yeah. And I totally see that if you are like a 
little bit hurt, you know, from all these external evaluations and evaluations 
and, you know, hearing.

You know, you're not there or you've gone or whatnot. Right. It's, it's not 
nice. So you have to prove somehow that, Yeah. But yeah, I'm super happy that 
you have this great role now Heather. Thank you so much. And you have your blog 
and that I could talk with you about it. I think it was very, very interesting.

And yeah, don't let anybody, you know, get some doubt into-- 

[00:42:19] **Heather:** --your head. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's definitely 
something everyone should take away. So yeah, if you're, if you're feeling 
scared or daunted about what's ahead of you, slice it all down into smaller 
chunks and, and just tackle those one by one.

Yeah. Baby steps. 

[00:42:38] **Michaela:** Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Thank you so much, 
Heather. Thank you. Thank you so much. Have a good, 

[00:42:43] **Heather:** You too. Bye.
