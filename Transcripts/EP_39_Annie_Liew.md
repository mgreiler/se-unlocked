# Episode 39 Annie Liew

**Michaela:** [00:00:00] Hello and welcome to the software engineering unlocked 
podcast. I'm your host, Dr. McKayla, and today I have the pleasure to talk to 
Annie Liew. But before I start, let me tell you about botnay.io, yho sponsors 
today's episode. 
Botany is 
a virtual assistant and personal coach for engineers. It helps you adopt better 
habits, improve your skills or automate your workflows.
So how does that work, you ask. Well, great question. Botany connects to the 
tools that your team uses and crunches through the data to find opportunities 
for you and your team to improve your skills, strengths, and collaboration, and 
improve processes and automate workflows. By gently and smartly nudging or 
reminding you, you stay on top of open tasks and learning and growth 
opportunities. In this way, Botany smoothly drives your new skill and habit 
acquisition. I love how it makes code reviews, 
and giving and receiving feedback a better experience for the whole team. But I 
guess it's best you try it out for yourself. 
For that hop over to botany.io to request access to the tool. 
So that is botany.io, but now back to Annie.

Annie is a 
designer who transitioned into software development.
I want to talk with her about how she got her first engineering job and how she 
now build soften his startup as the first engineering hire. So I'm super excited 
to have any year with me Annie, like come to the show.

**Annie:** [00:01:27]Thank you so much so happy to be here. 

**Michaela:** [00:01:30] Yeah. I'm really, really glad that you joined. 
So you have been a designer and then one day you wake up and you say, I now want 
to be an engineer, or how, how did that happen?
And what did you do about transitioning from design to engineering? 

**Annie:** [00:01:47] Yeah. So it's a bit of a long winded process. To be 
honest, I studied multimedia design at university and I worked for several years 
as a designer in Australia and in England. And after that I decided, okay, I 
wanted to change a pace. I really wanted to move to Japan because traveling is 
something that I really enjoy.
And so I actually went from design to being an English teacher for several years 
and then decided, okay, I'm going to move to. To Canada and try to get back into 
design, but because the landscape had changed so much, it was a real struggle. 
And I didn't know anybody in Toronto as well. So I basically was in this 
position where I was just like freelancing on the side, like trying to get my 
design hustle going.
But I was also lot working a bunch of minimal low low-paid jobs to kind of pay 
the bills at the same time. So I was kind of in this place where I was like, 
okay, this is not where I want to be. What can I do? How can I level up, how can 
I get the skills that I needed? And I looked into something called bootcamp.
At the beginning, I looked into a lot of UX boot camps, and then I found a 
school called hacker youth. They're called Juno now. But at the time, the only. 
The only boot camp that they offered was a front end web development boot camp. 
But I really, really liked the community that they built around it. So, you 
know, I've, I've built websites in the past before, and it wasn't something that 
I really enjoyed.
I really enjoyed the designing part of things, but I was always happy to hand 
off the coding. You know, part two, the developers, however, I did have to build 
websites and when I did them, I didn't enjoy at the time, but this time I 
thought, okay, let's try again. Let's see if something has changed. And so I 
started attending.
Small kind of little free, not seminars workshops around the Toronto area. And I 
was like, okay, what is this? Flexbox what is this? And everything had changed. 
And so I started getting really curious about it. And so I remember it was 
really interesting because I never, never thought that I'd be interested in 
code.
But after doing the workshops, I was like, okay, maybe I can do this. And so I 
applied for the bootcamp afterwards, got a subdued. And as they say, the rest of 
the street, 

**Michaela:** [00:04:10] Okay. Okay. And so you said you were mainly interested 
by the community. How did you, was it an online community or was it an offline 
community and how did you get in touch with the community?
How have you, you know, like, I imagine that you get access to the community 
after you joined, but it seems like you have, you knew the community exists even 
before you joined this particular 

**Annie:** [00:04:33] bootcamp. Yeah, that's a really, really great question. 
And that was a reason why I joined the community. I always have this idea that 
it's less about what you do and more about who you do it with.
I really, really liked this idea. And so the way like the hacker U has a really 
strong junior college has a really strong community because there's a lot of 
past alumni who shared about the journey. So I, I started contacting them and 
say, and asking them. Hey, how was your experience? Would you meet up for like a 
coffee so I could talk to you about it.
And I, and I went to several events and talk to a lot of them and every single 
one of them said, this was something that I don't regret. I a hundred percent 
recommended it. This was pre COVID. So the bootcamp was an in-person boot camp 
as well. So it was nine weeks of 10 to six. And then on top of that, you have 
your assignments and classes.
So it was just like a full-time in-person bootcamp. 

**Michaela:** [00:05:30] Okay, so it's nine weeks. So you make a commitment for 
nine weeks. You leave everything other aside, right. And you just go and do your 
work there. And I don't know. Do you have homework then? Or is that, do you do 
everything in class and then you go home and then that's it the next day you do 
it again.

**Annie:** [00:05:48] Yeah, well, it started easy, like off pretty, you know, 
easy where it was just like the 10 to six, but there's so much work. And the way 
that works is that you're, you're constantly building, um, projects. So there 
was no way that you would have been able to do everything just in the 10 to six. 
There's been like, it's, it's such a fun little, like, it's almost like a summer 
camp experience because we all had access to the school basically.
And there'll be nights when it's like midnight and there's like all my 
classmates around me and we're all just working hard and we have like pizza 
coming and it's just a really fun. And that's what I mean about community as 
well as it has a really fun atmosphere where you're doing something difficult.
You're trying to transition into this new career. But they're doing their best 
to, you know, support you along the way and make it fun. And, yeah, so it was, I 
don't think I actually went to the grocery store for about eight weeks because, 
and I'm really lucky to have a partner who could do that, but it was just so 
intense, like the work that I was doing, the purchase that I was doing and what 
I was learning, I just really didn't have time.
And a lot of people just didn't really have time to do other things. And 

**Michaela:** [00:06:58] so do you still have contact with a few of those people 
that you met 

**Annie:** [00:07:02] there? Yes. Yes I do. Yeah. And there's still a very 
strong alumni network as well. There's like a Slack alumni network. I Stu. Do 
some mentoring and I go back and help, like, you know, current students and I've 
spoken on some panels with them as well for people trying to get their first 
jobs.
So yeah, I'm still an active part of the community. And that's something I like 
about the school is that a lot of us alumni are still very active. Yeah. 

**Michaela:** [00:07:31] That's really nice. And so this thing had helped you 
also get your first job or how did you make that transition now from, okay. 
You're doing this nine weeks and then what happens then?

**Annie:** [00:07:41] Yeah, definitely. It helped me to get a good job because 
the school has a lot of industry contacts. And one of the things that they did 
was that we had an industry day where they invited a lot of potential employee 
years to a. An industry day where we all kind of showcased our work. It kind of 
almost works like a blind date.
If you think about it, where we all the students were sitting around tables and 
we had like a, a minute to give out pitch and to talk about ourselves and to 
share a project that we've really proud of. And then the bell rings and then 
they kind of let go to the next student. So it's like speed dating.
Yeah, it was completely like speed dating, but for employers versus, you know, 
and like potential employees. So it was really, it was like very stressful 
because all of us were trying to like practice our speeches and our pitches and, 
you know, like try to finalize the work that we wanted to show. But as a result 
of the industry day, I got invited to, to.
Interviews with some companies. And I ended up getting an offer, which I 
accepted a week later. So I was actually the first person from my cohort to 
accept the job. 

**Michaela:** [00:08:52] Yeah. Very cool. Very cool. And so how long has that a 
goal? 

**Annie:** [00:08:57] That was, I graduated in summer of 2019 and I started in 
August. Yep. 

**Michaela:** [00:09:03] And then you worked at that company as a software 
engineer.
Front-end software engineer. 

**Annie:** [00:09:09] Yes. So I was hired as a front end developer and I was 
there for a year and a year and a quarter. Was 

**Michaela:** [00:09:17] that experience, was that good? Did you feel like now 
you deepening your, your knowledge or did you learn a lot? 

**Annie:** [00:09:26] So the, the first job I had as a software developer 
basically was a, I worked for an agency.
And what that gave me was a lot of structure around things that you don't learn 
in bootcamp. So I got introduced to like agile methodology and stand up and the 
process of, you know, tickets and JIRA and a lot of soft skills that not soft 
skills, but a lot of processes, internal company processes that don't.
That you can't really learn in a bootcamp, but you have to learn them on the 
job. I also got exposure to one of the very big things was I got exposure to a 
lot of big, large code bases, some with legacy code, and I also had to build 
architect sites from. Like the ground-up. So, and I work with so many different 
websites.
It was a, they are a WordPress, VIP partner. So all our sites were done in 
WordPress, but I was doing like the architecture and, you know, like patient, 
most CSS and some Jacory as well. But because I had exposure to so many 
different types of websites and processes, it was a really big, yeah. It was a 
really big boost I would say, and definitely helped me to get my next job for 
sure.

**Michaela:** [00:10:38] And so is the next job that you done accepted? Is that 
the one that you're currently at is that the startup that you're working 

**Annie:** [00:10:44] for? That's correct. I've been there about four months. 

**Michaela:** [00:10:48] And so how does that happen? Like why did you change 
and why, why did you go from an agency to a startup? What was, what was the 
interest for you?

**Annie:** [00:11:02] so I was. I'd been working at the agency for quite a 
while. And because I was doing a lot of the same type of work, I wasn't feeling 
that I was starting to feel like I wasn't growing anymore. And I was also quite 
worried about my JavaScript skills in particular, because I was so comfortable 
doing all the site architecture in patient mode, CSS.
And I would basically get, like, I was basically lead in a lot of those. You 
know, for those projects that came up, but I wasn't really practicing my 
JavaScript or react skills. And those are things that we had learned in 
bootcamp. So it was, I was, I'm going to say that I'm really, really fortunate 
because Twitter actually played a big part in.
How I got this job or this offer, they, the company is called pesto and they 
were looking for a first hire someone to basically take over the front end. And 
they had a list of potential people that they wanted to reach out to and 
interview and invite them to go to the interview process. And I was one of them.
So. I didn't actually apply for this job, but the CTO reached out to me and 
said, Hey, I'm really like what you're doing. Sort of some of your work that 
you've shared, and we have this position coming up. Would you be interested in 
applying for it or going through the process? So I looked at the stack, it was 
next JS was reacting, was TypeScript.
It was all the kind of modern technologies that I really wanted to learn. And so 
I thought, okay, let's give this a go. And I did. And I went through like the 
interview process. I did a coding challenge, which was a take-home challenge for 
a week. I'd built an entire app for that. It was very stressful. I hadn't 
touched react for so long by that point.
So it was a lot of learning. I was still working and then trying to do this on 
the side. Yeah. It was a very, very stressful week. I remembered that, but it 
was definitely worth it. 

**Michaela:** [00:12:58] So now you are working in that startup and what are 
your responsibilities? 

**Annie:** [00:13:05] So because they, when they hired me, they, I knew that my 
JavaScript side of skills, weren't amazing.
And I told them I was very honest with them at the beginning. I said, I'm not 
going to be like a JavaScript Ninja from the get go, because I haven't worked 
professionally with JavaScript for so long. And David very aware of that. So 
they knew my abilities from the start. And one of my main responsibilities at 
this moment is just to.
Basically level up as fast as I can to get myself to a point where I can just do 
it really well and eventually be responsible for the entire front end. The other 
thing I do as well is I build features. We have like a roadmap where we, you 
know, Look at all the features that we have coming up and I get, and I work on 
an, on building.
Those features. Occasionally we have front end bugs come in as well, which I 
work on, but the two main things are the side that I am responsible for right 
now is building features and just like learning as fast as I can to get myself 
to a spot where I can be super comfortable. 

**Michaela:** [00:14:10] Yeah, I think that sounds like really good next step 
for you and the ability that you can grow in that role so much, how old is the 
startup and you know, how does that work?
A startup I imagine, right. Like extremely stressful and a lot of pressure or we 
have to ship. So how does that work in a startup that there's so much time for 
you to learn things and how, you know, Is everything actually running smoothly. 
And so it just doesn't need that. There's not too much presser pressure or how 
does it work?

**Annie:** [00:14:43] Yeah, that's a great question. So this startup actually 
started in March, 2017 and I got hired and started in October, October last 
year, October, 2020. So they have been going strong for just over four, almost 
four years, by that point that they hired me and they were. Basically profitable 
at that point.
So they decided to, you know, start growing and becoming like an actual company. 
So just to give you a bit of context, there's actually just three people in the 
startup. Before I got hired, it was the CTO and the CEO and the product guy. So 
a designer and engineer and operations. So. As they were growing, they realized 
they needed more help.
And that's kind of what I got hired for, because we're profitable at the moment. 
And we have a, our motto of, we have a SAS product that is a subscription model. 
We know that the money is coming in all the time. So while there is a bit of 
pressure to ship features and I definitely feel it, I think a lot of the 
pressure is more the internal pressure that I feel too.
Kind of validate that I belong here by shipping features, but I've had a lot of 
discussions with my, my CTO. And basically he said, one of the things that is 
important is that I'm able to learn to like, basically start slow to speed up 
later. So. They understand the importance of learning and growing as a junior 
developer was someone very early on in their career.
And they're thinking the long-term game it's, you know, I can like probably like 
try and just like really hustle and ship a lot of features, but would they be 
like really good features? Well, I actually learned the things I need to learn 
so that I can do it a lot better. You know, like later on for the company, I 
think it's like for everyone involved is really important that we have like a 
strong foundation built first so that we are able to then, you know, become a 
lot better and faster later on, I really 

**Michaela:** [00:16:49] liked this long-term vision and long-term thinking it's 
something that I think is quite the rare.
Even for large corporation that could definitely, you know, invest into their 
employees. There's often, you know, a very shortsighted action that I, that I 
feel like you have to provide value and you have to provide it now. But there 
are companies that I, that I hear really provide value also to the employees, 
like for example, automatic and all from several peoples that work there, they 
have also, for example, I think a really great place to work because.
When employees are in trouble, I always heard like they are there, right? Like 
they give you paid time off or like some time to breathe and to think and so on. 
And so I really liked that mindset as well, that, you know, they are getting 
someone on the team and they're investing in the person and I think. I don't 
know about you, but probably it also makes you very loyal to that, to that 

**Annie:** [00:17:46] company.
What you said about investment, because that was basically in some of my 
discussions with my CTO. They are definitely investing in me. So when I got 
hired, they knew that I had the skills coming in from as a designer and. You 
know, they didn't, they wanted someone who could basically have ownership of the 
front end and not have to worry about, Oh, can you move this pixel here?
Can you move that? The light that's all taken care of. I'm very, very pedantic 
about those details and let the UX and UI or things. They don't have to worry 
about that at all. So he says it's a lot easier to teach someone to code than to 
actually care about the product and how it looks and how it feels.
So, yeah, totally resonated with everything that you said there. Yeah. 

**Michaela:** [00:18:29] Yeah. And I think this is a really good perspective as 
well. Right? So you want action to the right people that are caring. And I think 
also people that feel cared for, and at least from what you're telling me here, 
it feels like you, you feel cared for which I think trans translates back.
Right. So it's, it's like giving and taking. So one thing that I'm super 
interested in as well is how do you experience. Developing software in a 
startup, like, what are the processes there? Is it very flexible? Do you have 
like mentorship? Do you have like code reviews? What about testing? You know, 
like what you're telling me, it's like two people, right?
So it's the CTO and you, so how do you do that? How much, how much formality is 
there and, and, and who takes over what. 

**Annie:** [00:19:18] Something that we discussed at the very beginning is that 
with processes, we don't have processes for processes sake. So that's because as 
a startup, we want to basically move fast and iterate on things and be able to 
push things up.
We basically follow a, although not formally, we follow an agile process where 
we have stand-ups, we do the sprints and we do retroactive at the end of the 
week to see what has gone well, what could be improved and then kind of 
reiterate on that. In terms of the, the product development process. We 
basically have roadmap meetings, roadmap, plannings, every one or two months, 
basically when we kind of look at the roadmap that we're building and seeing 
what features need to be built.
And the way we decide what features need to be built is based on the kind of two 
ideas. The first idea is a, is it something that has been requested? Is it 
something that customers have requested or is it something that we have some 
data around how customers are using our app? Is that something that they're 
doing often enough?
And then the second part of that is what is the potential impact of this 
feature? So for example, like maybe customers like request something and they 
requested a few times, but is that going to have a big impact on the company on 
like the usability of the, uh, like, will it help us to get more potential 
clients or, you know, so kind of those two things are two things that we think 
about when we, when we plan out our roadmap and look at all the features that we 
have available and we didn't do like a kind of one.
One, usually a one month plan where we work on, we prioritize the features that 
we're going to work on, and then we just basically go for it. In terms of 
mentorship, I have a very close relationship. I would say with my CTO slash 
manager, we do our one-on-ones. We talk very, very openly about things like 
imposter syndrome, how we want to shape the, the culture of the company, what 
kind of company that they want to be.
One of the things that really impressed me from the beginning was that they 
said, okay, and this was during the interview process. They said, we are very 
keen on building a great company culture. They're kind of the kind of company 
that people want to come and stay, but we don't want to have like high turnover.
We want our people to feel valued and we want them to have autonomy over their 
workflow and the things that they do. And we want them to have an impact, but 
you can definitely, definitely make an impact in our startup. So the TIFA. 
Management style that they have here is very, very suitable for me because I 
tend to get bored easily, but in a startup because I'm doing so many different 
things and have such a, I guess like impact or influence or ownership over the 
product is I feel very invested in the job and in the company.

**Michaela:** [00:22:08] When, when I actually started out of university, I 
thought like, what kind of company do I want to work for? And I was very 
impressed by these large corporations, but I think it was more the names than 
everything else. Right. And now over the time, I think my view shifted quite a 
bit because at a startup you can maybe make the whole, the whole half of the 
product, right.
Or maybe the whole product. There's definitely something there, which also right 
now fascinates me more like having more impact, having more, you know, like. 
Yeah, contributing more and also maybe different heads. That's something that I 
liked a lot. Actually, when I was working at Microsoft, I wasn't a very specific 
position.
Right. It was in the tool engineering teams. And so there, there was a lot of 
research, a lot of innovation, and that also had like a lot of hats, a lot of 
flexibility and a lot of impact, to be honest. But then when I wanted to 
transition, I looked at other teams and said, Oh, I don't know. I, this is a 
little bit too restrictive for me.
How is that for you? Do you have like several hats while do you have like 
probably designer hat, then you have maybe the developer hat, but other, other 
hats, I don't know, responsibilities that you take over in the 

**Annie:** [00:23:24] company? I wouldn't say that I have like responsibilities 
per se, but I would say that I have the flexibility to kind of shape the role 
that I'm in and.
Look into things that I'm interested in. So for example, one of the things that 
I did probably in the first couple of months is that I joined because with our 
clients, with our CEO, so that I could like talk to the client specifically and 
ask them questions about how they're using the product, how they like it.
And so that gave me a lot of. I guess empathy for our users and how they're 
using the product. And actually this product is something that I use myself. So 
I is like, I am the user at the same time as something that I'm building for 
myself. So it's interesting, but I also. Yeah. Like, because it's such a small 
company, we do a lot of different things.
For example, I don't have to do this. My core responsibility is to build 
features and like be in engineering. But one of the things that I also do is 
that. I, you know, sometimes I'll reach out to people. I think that we get a 
benefit from, from using pastel. And so that's something that I do as well. It's 
very, very, very, very flexible.
It's I've actually never worked in a company that has been so flexible before, 
like that, like any hierarchy, like structure is like quite flat. So everyone's 
just going responsible for everything we have. Like, we communicate very openly 
and discuss things and it's very much a process where it's very collaborative.
We all work together. And we're very intentional about the things that we do 
that would move the company or move the product forward. So, and also just going 
back to what you said about mentorship, and one of the things that. Attracted 
me, I guess, about large companies was the idea of mentorship. And because like, 
traditionally we feel like large companies have very formal processes in place 
for mentoring younger developers.
So it was something that I was very, very worried about when I first, when I was 
talking to the CTO, because there is no formal processes. It's a bit, it's a bit 
chaotic in many ways. So I. Asked him about that and we have code reviews. So I 
think maybe you're familiar with the idea that code reviews are in many ways, a 
form of mentorship anyway, because you know, you're getting your coffee with 
you.
You're getting a lot of feedback. He's very good at the feedback as well. He 
just, he doesn't tell me, just do this. He tells me the why. And yeah, it's like 
very, very detailed and it's, it's really helpful. But the other thing that we 
do very consistently, at least twice a week, if not more, is that we pair on a 
very regular basis.
And that's been an immense source of mentorship as well. 

**Michaela:** [00:26:04] Yeah, I think to be honest in a company like that's 
that small, right? And you have like the CTO as the main engineering person, you 
have excess. To the CTO, right? I mean, it means that it's the person that 
shaped the whole product that knows the architecture.
So which means in another company, there will be several layers that you have 
maybe to go through, or people are really busy maybe also, and here, because 
there is an investment from the CTO also in you. Right. It's in both interests 
to be like pairing and exchanging ideas and learning. And so, yeah, I can 
imagine that this is actually a really good spot to be in and have like.
Almost like, like a really personal mentorship, you know, th there are 
mentorship programs in larger organizations, but I don't think that people are 
that invested right in their mentees. Then probably your CTO is in you. Right. 
Because there is like higher stakes to make it work for that person. Right. So.
One thing that I wanted to touch base, which is a little bit out of context, but 
you mentioned it at the beginning. And I think it's interesting for a lot of 
people that are looking for jobs maybe that are coming out of would come, you 
know, coming or transitioning or coming out of college or whatnot.
Right. And getting a foot into Tash, you said, well, actually by Twitter was 
super helpful. So. How, how, how are you using your Twitter or how are you 
building your following? What's the value that you get out of Twitter and how 
can you, you know, how can others maybe also benefit from that and let it help 
them also a little bit in there in the job search.

**Annie:** [00:27:46] It's interesting because I was never really a social media 
person. I had to open our, my Twitter account because my bootcamp made us open 
the account. And I remember in the very early days, I had no idea how to use 
Twitter. I was like, okay, I have to tweet something. What do I talk about? How 
do I connect with people?
It was a very confusing kind of landscape for me because it was just a platform 
that I wasn't familiar with. And I hadn't used it before. When it started to 
change was when I, when the pandemic started and I'd been in my job for awhile 
and I was very comfortable with what I was doing, but I really wanted to level 
up.
So I joined a hundred days of code and I started sharing my process on, on 
Twitter. And that was when I started to meet more people, build a community and. 
Basically, that was how, like my following grow. I, I guess it was very 
unexpected. I wasn't expecting it. And it was very intimidating at the 
beginning, but in terms of why our boot camp made us open a Twitter account, it 
was because they knew the value of having a online, personal brand.
And your Twitter account or any other, like your LinkedIn and stuff, your 
website is all part of that overarching idea of your personal brand. And it's 
really helpful because a lot of companies do checks on you to see what kind of 
person you are outside of just the code that you do. And people hire other 
people for soft skills, not just, you know, like they can like, do like a 
for-loop and stuff, but it's actually like what, what you bring to the company 
and.
Twitter as is a way to not only kind of show the projects that you're working 
on, which I was doing. I was like doing a lot of projects and just showing them, 
or freely on Twitter and on cold pen as well. But it's also a chance for them to 
see who you are as a person. And I think that is the value of like Twitter or 
some of the other.
Um, social sharing social networks as well. Yeah. 

**Michaela:** [00:29:46] Okay, cool. So any, thank you so much for taking the 
time talking with me. Maybe I want to use the last few minutes to just catch up 
with things that you wanted to say to my listener, or, you know, like something 
that you want to leave. People were, I think especially people that are coming 
from bootcamps would be interested, people that are transitioning.
Right. What is your advice for them? What do you think? What should they, yeah. 
What, how do you think that they could make themselves successful? I set them up 
for success. 

**Annie:** [00:30:21] One of the things that I heard over and over again was 
that your network is so important and I really, it was something I really, 
really.
Um, felt when I started to get into coding because when I came to Toronto and I 
didn't have a network, it was extremely difficult for me to get into design. I 
didn't know anybody. And once I tapped into a network and a community, 
everything became so much easier. So there is a lot of value in reaching out to 
people, because at the end of the day, you do the things that you do, you don't.
Build features and products and cold by yourself. You build it in a team with 
other people and having mentorship and a mentor can also be just someone like 
who's a little bit ahead of you. If you can look on your current journey and 
give you advice on what you can do and just talk to them and kind of encourage 
you as well, having that kind of connection with someone who is already in the 
field or with a larger community, I think has a really large impact on, I would 
say a developer's career.
Something that I heard from somebody I remember this very clearly was that he 
said that the most successful developers, uh, people who have a large network to 
draw from, and also they're not kind of tied into one specific like technology 
or something. They're always kind of learning. They're always open to hearing 
about like more things and they have like a large depth or breadth of knowledge 
and.
They're successful because they can draw from all districts areas. And I think 
that's, that was like something that had always stuck with me. So. Yeah, like 
reaching, reach out to people, get involved in community, but also actually do 
work. The only reason that I was able to probably attract the attention of my 
current employee was because I was like really, really putting into putting in 
the hours of all the projects I was doing.
And I think it shows as well, like the kind of work that I was sharing. Like I 
had spent hours and hours on them and just kind of refining my skills, getting 
better and improving each time. So. Those are things that come across when 
you're sharing. And it's very easy for people, I guess, like as new devs to 
become very discouraged.
When, you know, you're looking for your first job and you get a lot of 
rejections and it's like, it's really hard. It's like so crushing, but you kind 
of have to understand that rejection is not. It's not personal. It might be just 
that the company didn't, it's not the right fit at the right time, or there's a 
lot of different factors and it's not like really personal and cut you kind of, 
kind of help you to get over that hump is just to do work that you want to be 
hired for, or you want other people to see.
And I think being able to show and share your work and show that you're 
passionate about what you do and that you're willing to learn is very, is very 
important. 

**Michaela:** [00:33:24] And so was that work that you showed and that you did, 
was that outside of work or were you able to showcase the work that you did for 
work?

**Annie:** [00:33:34] It was outside of work and that was because the work that 
I was doing at work belongs to the company and. I was comfortable with the job 
that I was doing this. So I wanted to learn other skills beyond the work that I 
was doing at work. And actually this brings out a really good point because 
something that, that maybe like you kind of feel, feel this as well, like tech 
is one of those industries where there's almost an expectation to work outside 
your job.
And I just want to clarify and say like, that is not expected and you definitely 
shouldn't do it because like a doctor doesn't, you know, practice like 
operations in like his or her free time. And like, I don't like the feeling that 
I have to, you know, work outside of my job, but it was something that I wanted 
to do personally to kind of level up because I wasn't getting the kind of skills 
I needed.
At my current job at that time. So that was the reason why I did it. 

**Michaela:** [00:34:35] I also think like building up those profiles, then we 
just touched on before, right. Is something that's really hard if you're 
employed, because most of the time the code doesn't belong to you. Right. And 
it's not something that you can easily share and say, Oh, look at my guitar.
There's my code that I write for my employer. That's confidential. Right. So if 
you want to fill your GitHub with nice stuff, it somehow. It means that you are 
doing stuff outside of work, but yeah, we have to be ready. The realistic that a 
lot of people are not, you know, they don't have the position to do because they 
have like a full-time job they have to care for.
Right. So, yeah, I think I understand. And they understand that this probably 
has a big impact, but it's also. I also, as you said, I'm not advocating or at 
all right. That people should, should need to do it, but it's, it's definitely 
interesting to, to hear that that's the way how you grow your following, how you 
grow your skills, right.
So there is a trade-off that you have to make and, you know, if you're in a 
position to do it, then that's great. And I think it's okay. Also not good to 
forbid people to do something outside. Right. I mean, sometimes it's what you 
have to do. That's how it is. 

**Annie:** [00:35:48] Right. And in lieu of that as well. I also think that's 
why having a network is so important because that's how you can get your next 
job without having to do all the extra work of learning outside of your full 
time job.
Yeah, 

**Michaela:** [00:36:00] exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Any, thank you so much for 
taking the time and talking with me today, it was really a pleasure to have you. 
I wish you all the best for your job and that you learn a lot and I will. 
Continue following you on Twitter and see what you're doing. And I'm really 
excited for you.
Thank you so much for being on my show. 

**Annie:** [00:36:20] Thank you for having 

**Michaela:** [00:36:20] me. Yeah, it was my pleasure. Okay, 

**Annie:** [00:36:23] bye.
